      "headline": "The history of the PMTools development",
      "shortdesc": "PMTools was created a little over 2 years, and during this two times it was rewritten from scratch.",
      "lines": {
        "first": "It was May 2019. And there was an extremely simple idea - to write a small program that would build streograms based on the results of magnetic treatment. This was necessary, because all the available programs that did this, among other things, exported stereograms that were not particularly convenient for subsequent use, which had to be manually completed for a long time in a graphics editor. For implementation, it was decided to use Python, Matplotlib, Pandas and PyQt5. Here's what the results of a week's work on it looked like:",
        "second": "Having created this, it became clear that PyQT5 is not suitable for the task at hand, like Matplotlip. Therefore, the search for new ways to accomplish the task began. Variants in Python and C++ were considered. All C++ solutions were overly complex, and it was clear that implementation in this language would take too much time and effort. That's why Python was chosen. After a couple of weeks of searching and analyzing suitable solutions for this, among the libraries and frameworks, the choice fell on Plotly. At that time, this company had in its arsenal the charting library of the same name and the emerging framework for building web applications in Python - Dash. Thus, armed with Plotly and Dash, this was created over the summer of 2019:",
        "third": "And over the following months, at a slow pace, minor improvements and minor changes were made:",
        "fourth": "The created program was called PMTools and it was already something more than just a streogram builder. It was already a web application for component analysis, and also provided the ability to calculate the Fisher mean and build a stereogram setup, and a small paleomagnetic calculator was also created. However, it quickly became clear that this was not the final product, but rather an alpha version.",
        "fifth": "Until the summer of 2020, it was necessary to decide how to make the next version of PMTools. It was clear that creating something really functional with Plotly and Dash would be difficult, as customizing all the built-in charts and other components would be too extensive, and sometimes even impossible. It was decided to write the next version in pure JavaScript. A similar web application from Palaomagnetism.org was taken as a guide. To speed up the development of graphics part, it was decided to build using ready-made tools, an analysis was made of various libraries and frameworks for building charts in JavaScript, as a result, the HighCharts library was chosen. At the same time, the researchers for whom PMTools was created asked to make it desktop, independent of the Internet connection. And so it was decided to use Electron. By the summer's end, this was created",
        "sixth": "The new version of PMTools already made it possible to carry out a full cycle of paleomagnetic operations: component analysis, direction statistics, and calculation of poles. It was desktop and independent of internet connection. This version of PMTools has already been actively used by researchers. The version has been marked as beta.",
        "seventh": "However, there were performance issues. Here it is worth noting that although it was 2020/2021, nevertheless, the jQuery library was widely used in PMTools and at the same time there were attempts to implement modularity, which, alas, did not was successful due to architectural problems at all levels of the program. Further, the author had, in a sense, a sabbatical:",
        "eighth": "After this vacation, it was decided to rewrite PMTools on the TypeScript / React / Redux stack, make it a full-fledged web application and temporarily abandon the idea of ​​a desktop application. In the period from February 2021 to May 2022, PMTools was created from scratch on the specified technology stack, while it was decided to make all the charts on our own, without using any libraries to build them, since it was with such an implementation that full control over the display of data was achieved. As a result, in May 2022, PMTools v.2.0 was released."
