# Changelog

## [0.15.6.2] - 2026-04-04 — Anti-Skip Review Rule

Review skills now enforce that every section gets evaluated, regardless of plan type. No more "this is a strategy doc so implementation sections don't apply." If a section genuinely has nothing to flag, say so and move on, but you have to look.

### Added

- **Anti-skip rule in all 4 review skills.** CEO review (sections 1-11), eng review (sections 1-4), design review (passes 1-7), and DX review (passes 1-8) all now require explicit evaluation of every section. Models can no longer skip sections by claiming the plan type makes them irrelevant.
- **CEO review header fix.** Corrected "10 sections" to "11 sections" to match the actual section count (Section 11 is conditional but exists).

## [0.15.6.1] - 2026-04-04

### Fixed

- **Skill prefix self-healing.** Setup now runs `gstack-relink` as a final consistency check after linking skills. If an interrupted setup, stale git state, or upgrade left your `name:` fields out of sync with `skill_prefix: false`, setup will auto-correct on the next run. No more `/gstack-qa` when you wanted `/qa`.

## [0.15.6.0] - 2026-04-04 — Declarative Multi-Host Platform

Adding a new coding agent to gstack used to mean touching 9 files and knowing the internals of `gen-skill-docs.ts`. Now it's one TypeScript config file and a re-export. Zero code changes elsewhere. Tests auto-parameterize.

### Added

- **Declarative host config system.** Every host is a typed `HostConfig` object in `hosts/*.ts`. The generator, setup, skill-check, platform-detect, uninstall, and worktree copy all consume configs instead of hardcoded switch statements. Adding a host = one file + re-export in `hosts/index.ts`.
- **4 new hosts: OpenCode, Slate, Cursor, OpenClaw.** `bun run gen:skill-docs --host all` now generates for 8 hosts. Each produces valid SKILL.md output with zero `.claude/skills` path leakage.
- **OpenClaw adapter.** OpenClaw gets a hybrid approach: config for paths/frontmatter/detection + a post-processing adapter for semantic tool mapping (Bash→exec, Agent→sessions_spawn, AskUserQuestion→prose). Includes `SOUL.md` via `staticFiles` config.
- **106 new tests.** 71 tests for config validation, HOST_PATHS derivation, export CLI, golden-file regression, and per-host correctness. 35 parameterized smoke tests covering all 7 external hosts (output exists, no path leakage, frontmatter valid, freshness, skip rules).
- **`host-config-export.ts` CLI.** Exposes host configs to bash scripts via `list`, `get`, `detect`, `validate`, `symlinks` commands. No YAML parsing needed in bash.
- **Contributor `/gstack-contrib-add-host` skill.** Guides new host config creation. Lives in `contrib/`, excluded from user installs.
- **Golden-file baselines.** Snapshots of ship/SKILL.md for Claude, Codex, and Factory verify the refactor produces identical output.
- **Per-host install instructions in README.** Every supported agent has its own copy-paste install block.

### Changed

- **`gen-skill-docs.ts` is now config-driven.** EXTERNAL_HOST_CONFIG, transformFrontmatter host branches, path/tool rewrite if-chains, ALL_HOSTS array, and skill skip logic all replaced with config lookups.
- **`types.ts` derives Host type from configs.** No more hardcoded `'claude' | 'codex' | 'factory'`. HOST_PATHS built dynamically from each config's globalRoot/usesEnvVars.
- **Preamble, co-author trailer, resolver suppression all read from config.** hostConfigDir, co-author strings, and suppressedResolvers driven by host configs instead of per-host switch statements.
- **`skill-check.ts`, `worktree.ts`, `platform-detect` iterate configs.** No per-host blocks to maintain.

### Fixed

- **Sidebar E2E tests now self-contained.** Fixed stale URL assertion in sidebar-url-accuracy, simplified sidebar-css-interaction task. All 3 sidebar tests pass without external browser dependencies.

## [0.15.5.0] - 2026-04-04 — Interactive DX Review + Plan Mode Skill Fix

`/plan-devex-review` now feels like sitting down with a developer advocate who has used 100 CLI tools. Instead of speed-running 8 scores, it asks who your developer is, benchmarks you against competitors' onboarding times, makes you design your magical moment, and traces every friction point step by step before scoring anything.

### Added

- **Developer persona interrogation.** The review starts by asking WHO your developer is, with concrete archetypes (YC founder, platform engineer, frontend dev, OSS contributor). The persona shapes every question for the rest of the review.
- **Empathy narrative as conversation starter.** A first-person "I'm a developer who just found your tool..." walkthrough gets shown to you for reaction before any scoring begins. You correct it, and the corrected version goes into the plan.
- **Competitive DX benchmarking.** WebSearch finds your competitors' TTHW and onboarding approaches. You pick your target tier (Champion < 2min, Competitive 2-5min, or current trajectory). That target follows you through every pass.
- **Magical moment design.** You choose how developers should experience the "oh wow" moment: playground, demo command, video, or guided tutorial, with effort/tradeoff analysis.
- **Three review modes.** DX EXPANSION (push for best-in-class), DX POLISH (bulletproof every touchpoint), DX TRIAGE (critical gaps only, ship soon).
- **Friction-point journey tracing.** Instead of a static table, the review traces actual README/docs paths and asks one AskUserQuestion per friction point found.
- **First-time developer roleplay.** A timestamped confusion report from your persona's perspective, grounded in actual docs and code.

### Fixed

- **Skill invocation during plan mode.** When you invoke a skill (like `/plan-ceo-review`) during plan mode, Claude now treats it as executable instructions instead of ignoring it and trying to exit. The loaded skill takes precedence over generic plan mode behavior. STOP points actually stop. This fix ships in every skill's preamble.

## [0.15.4.0] - 2026-04-03 — Autoplan DX Integration + Docs

`/autoplan` now auto-detects developer-facing plans and runs `/plan-devex-review` as Phase 3.5, with full dual-voice adversarial review (Claude subagent + Codex). If your plan mentions APIs, CLIs, SDKs, agent actions, or anything developers integrate with, the DX review kicks in automatically. No extra commands needed.

### Added

- **DX review in /autoplan.** Phase 3.5 runs after Eng review when developer-facing scope is detected. Includes DX-specific dual voices, consensus table, and full 8-dimension scorecard. Triggers on APIs, CLIs, SDKs, shell commands, Claude Code skills, OpenClaw actions, MCP servers, and anything devs implement or debug.
- **"Which review?" comparison table in README.** Quick reference showing which review to use for end users vs developers vs architecture, and when `/autoplan` covers all three.
- **`/plan-devex-review` and `/devex-review` in install instructions.** Both skills now listed in the copy-paste install prompt so new users discover them immediately.

### Changed

- **Autoplan pipeline order.** Now CEO → Design → Eng → DX (was CEO → Design → Eng). DX runs last because it benefits from knowing the architecture.

## [0.15.3.0] - 2026-04-03 — Developer Experience Review

You can now review plans for DX quality before writing code. `/plan-devex-review` rates 8 dimensions (getting started, API design, error messages, docs, upgrade path, dev environment, community, measurement) on a 0-10 scale with trend tracking across reviews. After shipping, `/devex-review` uses the browse tool to actually test the live experience and compare against plan-stage scores.

### Added

- **/plan-devex-review skill.** Plan-stage DX review based on Addy Osmani's framework. Auto-detects product type (API, CLI, SDK, library, platform, docs, Claude Code skill). Includes developer empathy simulation, DX scorecard with trends, and a conditional Claude Code Skill DX checklist for reviewing skills themselves.
- **/devex-review skill.** Live DX audit using the browse tool. Tests docs, getting started flows, error messages, and CLI help. Each dimension scored as TESTED, INFERRED, or N/A with screenshot evidence. Boomerang comparison: plan said TTHW would be 3 minutes, reality says 8.
- **DX Hall of Fame reference.** On-demand examples from Stripe, Vercel, Elm, Rust, htmx, Tailwind, and more, loaded per review pass to avoid prompt bloat.
- **`{{DX_FRAMEWORK}}` resolver.** Shared DX principles, characteristics, and scoring rubric for both skills. Compact (~150 lines) so it doesn't eat context.
- **DX Review in the dashboard.** Both skills write to the review log and show up in the Review Readiness Dashboard alongside CEO, Eng, and Design reviews.

## [0.15.2.1] - 2026-04-02 — Setup Runs Migrations

`git pull && ./setup` now applies version migrations automatically. Previously, migrations only ran during `/gstack-upgrade`, so users who updated via git pull never got state fixes (like the skill directory restructure from v0.15.1.0). Now `./setup` tracks the last version it ran at and applies any pending migrations on every run.

### Fixed

- **Setup runs pending migrations.** `./setup` now checks `~/.gstack/.last-setup-version` and runs any migration scripts newer than that version. No more broken skill directories after `git pull`.
- **Space-safe migration loop.** Uses `while read` instead of `for` loop to handle paths with spaces correctly.
- **Fresh installs skip migrations.** New installs write the version marker without running historical migrations that don't apply to them.
- **Future migration guard.** Migrations for versions newer than the current VERSION are skipped, preventing premature execution from development branches.
- **Missing VERSION guard.** If the VERSION file is absent, the version marker isn't written, preventing permanent migration poisoning.

## [0.15.2.0] - 2026-04-02 — Voice-Friendly Skill Triggers

Say "run a security check" instead of remembering `/cso`. Skills now have voice-friendly trigger phrases that work with AquaVoice, Whisper, and other speech-to-text tools. No more fighting with acronyms that get transcribed wrong ("CSO" -> "CEO" -> wrong skill).

### Added

- **Voice triggers for 10 skills.** Each skill gets natural-language aliases baked into its description. "see-so", "security review", "tech review", "code x", "speed test" and more. The right skill activates even when speech-to-text mangles the command name.
- **`voice-triggers:` YAML field in templates.** Structured authoring: add aliases to any `.tmpl` frontmatter, `gen-skill-docs` folds them into the description during generation. Clean source, clean output.
- **Voice input section in README.** New users know skills work with voice from day one.
- **`voice-triggers` documented in CONTRIBUTING.md.** Frontmatter contract updated so contributors know the field exists.

## [0.15.1.0] - 2026-04-01 — Design Without Shotgun

You can now run `/design-html` without having to run `/design-shotgun` first. The skill detects what design context exists (CEO plans, design review artifacts, approved mockups) and asks how you want to proceed. Start from a plan, a description, or a provided PNG, not just an approved mockup.

### Changed

- **`/design-html` works from any starting point.** Three routing modes: (A) approved mockup from /design-shotgun, (B) CEO plan and/or design variants without formal approval, (C) clean slate with just a description. Each mode asks the right questions and proceeds accordingly.
- **AskUserQuestion for missing context.** Instead of blocking with "no approved design found," the skill now offers choices: run the planning skills first, provide a PNG, or just describe what you want and design live.

### Fixed

- **Skills now discovered as top-level names.** Setup creates real directories with SKILL.md symlinks inside instead of directory symlinks. This fixes Claude auto-prefixing skill names with `gstack-` when using `--no-prefix` mode. `/qa` is now just `/qa`, not `/gstack-qa`.

## [0.15.0.0] - 2026-04-01 — Session Intelligence

Your AI sessions now remember what happened. Plans, reviews, checkpoints, and health scores survive context compaction and compound across sessions. Every skill writes a timeline event, and the preamble reads recent artifacts on startup so the agent knows where you left off.

### Added

- **Session timeline.** Every skill auto-logs start/complete events to `timeline.jsonl`. Local-only, never sent anywhere, always on regardless of telemetry setting. /retro can now show "this week: 3 /review, 2 /ship across 3 branches."
- **Context recovery.** After compaction or session start, the preamble lists your recent CEO plans, checkpoints, and reviews. The agent reads the most recent one to recover decisions and progress without asking you to repeat yourself.
- **Cross-session injection.** On session start, the preamble prints your last skill run on this branch and your latest checkpoint. You see "Last session: /review (success)" before typing anything.
- **Predictive skill suggestion.** If your last 3 sessions on a branch follow a pattern (review, ship, review), gstack suggests what you probably want next.
- **Welcome back message.** Sessions synthesize a one-paragraph briefing: branch name, last skill, checkpoint status, health score.
- **`/checkpoint` skill.** Save and resume working state snapshots. Captures git state, decisions made, remaining work. Supports cross-branch listing for Conductor workspace handoff between agents.
- **`/health` skill.** Code quality scorekeeper. Wraps your project's tools (tsc, biome, knip, shellcheck, tests), computes a composite 0-10 score, tracks trends over time. When the score drops, it tells you exactly what changed and where to fix it.
- **Timeline binaries.** `bin/gstack-timeline-log` and `bin/gstack-timeline-read` for append-only JSONL timeline storage.
- **Routing rules.** /checkpoint and /health added to the skill routing injection.

## [0.14.6.0] - 2026-03-31 — Recursive Self-Improvement

gstack now learns from its own mistakes. Every skill session captures operational failures (CLI errors, wrong approaches, project quirks) and surfaces them in future sessions. No setup needed, just works.

### Added

- **Operational self-improvement.** When a command fails or you hit a project-specific gotcha, gstack logs it. Next session, it remembers. "bun test needs --timeout 30000" or "login flow requires cookie import first" ... the kind of stuff that wastes 10 minutes every time you forget it.
- **Learnings summary in preamble.** When your project has 5+ learnings, gstack shows the top 3 at the start of every session so you see them before you start working.
- **13 skills now learn.** office-hours, plan-ceo-review, plan-eng-review, plan-design-review, design-review, design-consultation, cso, qa, qa-only, and retro all now read prior learnings AND contribute new ones. Previously only review, ship, and investigate were wired.

### Changed

- **Contributor mode replaced.** The old contributor mode (manual opt-in, markdown reports to ~/.gstack/contributor-logs/) never fired in 18 days of heavy use. Replaced with automatic operational learning that captures the same insights without any setup.

### Fixed

- **learnings-show E2E test slug mismatch.** The test seeded learnings at a hardcoded path but gstack-slug computed a different path at runtime. Now computes the slug dynamically.

## [0.14.5.0] - 2026-03-31 — Ship Idempotency + Skill Prefix Fix

Re-running `/ship` after a failed push or PR creation no longer double-bumps your version or duplicates your CHANGELOG. And if you use `--prefix` mode, your skill names actually work now.

### Fixed

- **`/ship` is now idempotent (#649).** If push succeeds but PR creation fails (API outage, rate limit), re-running `/ship` detects the already-bumped VERSION, skips the push if already up to date, and updates the existing PR body instead of creating a duplicate. The CHANGELOG step was already idempotent by design ("replace with unified entry"), so no guard needed there.
- **Skill prefix actually patches `name:` in SKILL.md (#620, #578).** `./setup --prefix` and `gstack-relink` now patch the `name:` field in each skill's SKILL.md frontmatter to match the prefix setting. Previously, symlinks were prefixed but Claude Code read the unprefixed `name:` field and ignored the prefix entirely. Edge cases handled: `gstack-upgrade` not double-prefixed, root `gstack` skill never prefixed, prefix removal restores original names.
- **`gen-skill-docs` warns when prefix patches need re-applying.** After regenerating SKILL.md files, if `skill_prefix: true` is set in config, a warning reminds you to run `gstack-relink`.
- **PR idempotency checks open state.** The PR guard now verifies the existing PR is `OPEN`, so closed PRs don't block new PR creation.
- **`--no-prefix` ordering bug.** `gstack-patch-names` now runs before `link_claude_skill_dirs` so symlink names reflect the correct patched values.

### Added

- **`bin/gstack-patch-names` shared helper.** DRY extraction of the name-patching logic used by both `setup` and `gstack-relink`. Handles all edge cases (no frontmatter, already-prefixed, inherently-prefixed dirs) with portable `mktemp + mv` sed.

### For contributors

- 4 unit tests for name: patching in `relink.test.ts`
- 2 tests for gen-skill-docs prefix warning
- 1 E2E test for ship idempotency (periodic tier)
- Updated `setupMockInstall` to write SKILL.md with proper frontmatter

## [0.14.4.0] - 2026-03-31 — Review Army: Parallel Specialist Reviewers

Every `/review` now dispatches specialist subagents in parallel. Instead of one agent applying one giant checklist, you get focused reviewers for testing gaps, maintainability, security, performance, data migrations, API contracts, and adversarial red-teaming. Each specialist reads the diff independently with fresh context, outputs structured JSON findings, and the main agent merges, deduplicates, and boosts confidence when multiple specialists flag the same issue. Small diffs (<50 lines) skip specialists entirely for speed. Large diffs (200+ lines) activate the Red Team for adversarial analysis on top.

### Added

- **7 specialist reviewers** running in parallel via Agent tool subagents. Always-on: Testing + Maintainability. Conditional: Security (auth scope), Performance (backend/frontend), Data Migration (migration files), API Contract (controllers/routes), Red Team (large diffs or critical findings).
- **JSON finding schema.** Specialists output structured JSON objects with severity, confidence, path, line, category, fix, and fingerprint fields. Reliable parsing, no more pipe-delimited text.
- **Fingerprint-based dedup.** When two specialists flag the same file:line:category, the finding gets boosted confidence and a "MULTI-SPECIALIST CONFIRMED" marker.
- **PR Quality Score.** Every review computes a 0-10 quality score: `10 - (critical * 2 + informational * 0.5)`. Logged to review history for trending via `/retro`.
- **3 new diff-scope signals.** `gstack-diff-scope` now detects SCOPE_MIGRATIONS, SCOPE_API, and SCOPE_AUTH to activate the right specialists.
- **Learning-informed specialist prompts.** Each specialist gets past learnings for its domain injected into the prompt, so reviews get smarter over time.
- **14 new diff-scope tests** covering all 9 scope signals including the 3 new ones.
- **7 new E2E tests** (5 gate, 2 periodic) covering migration safety, N+1 detection, delivery audit, quality score, JSON schema compliance, red team activation, and multi-specialist consensus.

### Changed

- **Review checklist refactored.** Categories now covered by specialists (test gaps, dead code, magic numbers, performance, crypto) removed from the main checklist. Main agent focuses on CRITICAL pass only.
- **Delivery Integrity enhanced.** The existing plan completion audit now investigates WHY items are missing (not just that they're missing) and logs plan-file discrepancies as learnings. Commit-message inference is informational only, never persisted.

## [0.14.3.0] - 2026-03-31 — Always-On Adversarial Review + Scope Drift + Plan Mode Design Tools

Every code review now runs adversarial analysis from both Claude and Codex, regardless of diff size. A 5-line auth change gets the same cross-model scrutiny as a 500-line feature. The old "skip adversarial for small diffs" heuristic is gone... diff size was never a good proxy for risk.

### Added

- **Always-on adversarial review.** Every `/review` and `/ship` run now dispatches both a Claude adversarial subagent and a Codex adversarial challenge. No more tier-based skipping. The Codex structured review (formal P1 pass/fail gate) still runs on large diffs (200+ lines) where the formal gate adds value.
- **Scope drift detection in `/ship`.** Before shipping, `/ship` now checks whether you built what you said you'd build, nothing more, nothing less. Catches scope creep ("while I was in there..." changes) and missing requirements. Results appear in the PR body.
- **Plan Mode Safe Operations.** Browse screenshots, design mockups, Codex outside voices, and writing to `~/.gstack/` are now explicitly allowed in plan mode. Design-related skills (`/design-consultation`, `/design-shotgun`, `/design-html`, `/plan-design-review`) can generate visual artifacts during planning without fighting plan mode restrictions.

### Changed

- **Adversarial opt-out split.** The legacy `codex_reviews=disabled` config now only gates Codex passes. Claude adversarial subagent always runs since it's free and fast. Previously the kill switch disabled everything.
- **Cross-model tension format.** Outside voice disagreements now include `RECOMMENDATION` and `Completeness` scores, matching the standard AskUserQuestion format used everywhere else in gstack.
- **Scope drift is now a shared resolver.** Extracted from `/review` into `generateScopeDrift()` so both `/review` and `/ship` use the same logic. DRY.

## [0.14.2.0] - 2026-03-30 — Sidebar CSS Inspector + Per-Tab Agents

The sidebar is now a visual design tool. Pick any element on the page and see the full CSS rule cascade, box model, and computed styles right in the Side Panel. Edit styles live and see changes instantly. Each browser tab gets its own independent agent, so you can work on multiple pages simultaneously without cross-talk. Cleanup is LLM-powered... the agent snapshots the page, understands it semantically, and removes the junk while keeping the site's identity.

### Added

- **CSS Inspector in the sidebar.** Click "Pick Element", hover over anything, click it, and the sidebar shows the full CSS rule cascade with specificity badges, source file:line, box model visualization (gstack palette colors), and computed styles. Like Chrome DevTools, but inside the sidebar.
- **Live style editing.** `$B style .selector property value` modifies CSS rules in real time via CDP. Changes show instantly on the page. Undo with `$B style --undo`.
- **Per-tab agents.** Each browser tab gets its own Claude agent process via `BROWSE_TAB` env var. Switch tabs in the browser and the sidebar swaps to that tab's chat history. Ask questions about different pages in parallel without agents fighting over which tab is active.
- **Tab tracking.** User-created tabs (Cmd+T, right-click "Open in new tab") are automatically tracked via `context.on('page')`. The sidebar tab bar updates in real time. Click a tab in the sidebar to switch the browser. Close a tab and it disappears.
- **LLM-powered page cleanup.** The cleanup button sends a prompt to the sidebar agent (which IS an LLM). The agent runs a deterministic first pass, snapshots the page, analyzes what's left, and removes clutter intelligently while preserving site branding. Works on any site without brittle CSS selectors.
- **Pretty screenshots.** `$B prettyscreenshot --cleanup --scroll-to ".pricing" ~/Desktop/hero.png` combines cleanup, scroll positioning, and screenshot in one command.
- **Stop button.** A red stop button appears in the sidebar when an agent is working. Click it to cancel the current task.
- **CSP fallback for inspector.** Sites with strict Content Security Policy (like SF Chronicle) now get a basic picker via the always-loaded content script. You see computed styles, box model, and same-origin CSS rules. Full CDP mode on sites that allow it.
- **Cleanup + Screenshot buttons in chat toolbar.** Not hidden in debug... right there in the chat. Disabled when disconnected so you don't get error spam.

### Fixed

- **Inspector message allowlist.** The background.js allowlist was missing all inspector message types, silently rejecting them. The inspector was broken for all pages, not just CSP-restricted ones. (Found by Codex review.)
- **Sticky nav preservation.** Cleanup no longer removes the site's top nav bar. Sorts sticky elements by position and preserves the first full-width element near the top.
- **Agent won't stop.** System prompt now tells the agent to be concise and stop when done. No more endless screenshot-and-highlight loops.
- **Focus stealing.** Agent commands no longer pull Chrome to the foreground. Internal tab pinning uses `bringToFront: false`.
- **Chat message dedup.** Old messages from previous sessions no longer repeat on reconnect.

### Changed

- **Sidebar banner** now says "Browser co-pilot" instead of the old mode-specific text.
- **Input placeholder** is "Ask about this page..." (more inviting than the old placeholder).
- **System prompt** includes prompt injection defense and allowed-commands whitelist from the security audit.

## [0.14.1.0] - 2026-03-30 — Comparison Board is the Chooser

The design comparison board now always opens automatically when reviewing variants. No more inline image + "which do you prefer?" — the board has rating controls, comments, remix/regenerate buttons, and structured feedback output. That's the experience. All 3 design skills (/plan-design-review, /design-shotgun, /design-consultation) get this fix.

### Changed

- **Comparison board is now mandatory.** After generating design variants, the agent creates a comparison board with `$D compare --serve` and sends you the URL via AskUserQuestion. You interact with the board, click Submit, and the agent reads your structured feedback from `feedback.json`. No more polling loops as the primary wait mechanism.
- **AskUserQuestion is the wait, not the chooser.** The agent uses AskUserQuestion to tell you the board is open and wait for you to finish, not to present variants inline and ask for preferences. The board URL is always included so you can click through if you lost the tab.
- **Serve-failure fallback improved.** If the comparison board server can't start, variants are shown inline via Read tool before asking for preferences — you're no longer choosing blind.

### Fixed

- **Board URL corrected.** The recovery URL now points to `http://127.0.0.1:<PORT>/` (where the server actually serves) instead of `/design-board.html` (which would 404).

## [0.14.0.0] - 2026-03-30 — Design to Code

You can now go from an approved design mockup to production-quality HTML with one command. `/design-html` takes the winning design from `/design-shotgun` and generates Pretext-native HTML where text actually reflows on resize, heights adjust to content, and layouts are dynamic. No more hardcoded CSS heights or broken text overflow.

### Added

- **`/design-html` skill.** Takes an approved mockup from `/design-shotgun` and generates self-contained HTML with Pretext for computed text layout. Smart API routing picks the right Pretext patterns for each design type (simple layouts, card grids, chat bubbles, editorial spreads). Includes a refinement loop where you preview in browser, give feedback, and iterate until it's right.
- **Pretext vendored.** 30KB Pretext source bundled in `design-html/vendor/pretext.js` for offline, zero-dependency HTML output. Framework output (React/Svelte/Vue) uses npm install instead.
- **Design pipeline chaining.** `/design-shotgun` Step 6 now offers `/design-html` as the next step. `/design-consultation` suggests it after producing screen-level designs. `/plan-design-review` chains to both `/design-shotgun` and `/design-html` alongside review skills.

### Changed

- **`/plan-design-review` next steps expanded.** Previously only chained to other review skills. Now also offers `/design-shotgun` (explore variants) and `/design-html` (generate HTML from approved mockups).

## [0.13.10.0] - 2026-03-29 — Office Hours Gets a Reading List

Repeat /office-hours users now get fresh, curated resources every session instead of the same YC closing. 34 hand-picked videos and essays from Garry Tan, Lightcone Podcast, YC Startup School, and Paul Graham, contextually matched to what came up during the session. The system remembers what it already showed you, so you never see the same recommendation twice.

### Added

- **Rotating founder resources in /office-hours closing.** 34 curated resources across 5 categories (Garry Tan videos, YC Backstory, Lightcone Podcast, YC Startup School, Paul Graham essays). Claude picks 2-3 per session based on session context, not randomly.
- **Resource dedup log.** Tracks which resources were shown in `~/.gstack/projects/$SLUG/resources-shown.jsonl` so repeat users always see fresh content.
- **Resource selection analytics.** Logs which resources get picked to `skill-usage.jsonl` so you can see patterns over time.
- **Browser-open offer.** After showing resources, offers to open them in your browser so you can check them out later.

### Fixed

- **Build script chmod safety net.** `bun build --compile` output now gets `chmod +x` explicitly, preventing "permission denied" errors when binaries lose execute permission during workspace cloning or file transfer.

## [0.13.9.0] - 2026-03-29 — Composable Skills

Skills can now load other skills inline. Write `{{INVOKE_SKILL:office-hours}}` in a template and the generator emits the right "read file, skip preamble, follow instructions" prose automatically. Handles host-aware paths and customizable skip lists.

### Added

- **`{{INVOKE_SKILL:skill-name}}` resolver.** Composable skill loading as a first-class resolver. Emits host-aware prose that tells Claude or Codex to read another skill's SKILL.md and follow it inline, skipping preamble sections. Supports optional `skip=` parameter for additional sections to skip.
- **Parameterized resolver support.** The placeholder regex now handles `{{NAME:arg1:arg2}}`, enabling resolvers that take arguments at generation time. Fully backward compatible with existing `{{NAME}}` patterns.
- **`{{CHANGELOG_WORKFLOW}}` resolver.** Changelog generation logic extracted from /ship into a reusable resolver. Includes voice guidance ("lead with what the user can now do") inline.
- **Frontmatter `name:` for skill registration.** Setup script and gen-skill-docs now read `name:` from SKILL.md frontmatter for symlink naming. Enables directory names that differ from invocation names (e.g., `run-tests/` directory registered as `/test`).
- **Proactive skill routing.** Skills now ask once to add routing rules to your project's CLAUDE.md. This makes Claude invoke the right skill automatically instead of answering directly. Your choice is remembered in `~/.gstack/config.yaml`.
- **Annotated config file.** `~/.gstack/config.yaml` now gets a documented header on first creation explaining every setting. Edit it anytime.

### Changed

- **BENEFITS_FROM now delegates to INVOKE_SKILL.** Eliminated duplicated skip-list logic. The prerequisite offer wrapper stays in BENEFITS_FROM, but the actual "read and follow" instructions come from INVOKE_SKILL.
- **/plan-ceo-review mid-session fallback uses INVOKE_SKILL.** The "user can't articulate the problem, offer /office-hours" path now uses the composable resolver instead of inline prose.
- **Stronger routing language.** office-hours, investigate, and ship descriptions now say "Proactively invoke" instead of "Proactively suggest" for more reliable automatic skill invocation.

### Fixed

- **Config grep anchored to line start.** Commented header lines no longer shadow real config values.

## [0.13.8.0] - 2026-03-29 — Security Audit Round 2

Browse output is now wrapped in trust boundary markers so agents can tell page content from tool output. Markers are escape-proof. The Chrome extension validates message senders. CDP binds to localhost only. Bun installs use checksum verification.

### Fixed

- **Trust boundary markers are escape-proof.** URLs sanitized (no newlines), marker strings escaped in content. A malicious page can't forge the END marker to break out of the untrusted block.

### Added

- **Content trust boundary markers.** Every browse command that returns page content (`text`, `html`, `links`, `forms`, `accessibility`, `console`, `dialog`, `snapshot`, `diff`, `resume`, `watch stop`) wraps output in `--- BEGIN/END UNTRUSTED EXTERNAL CONTENT ---` markers. Agents know what's page content vs tool output.
- **Extension sender validation.** Chrome extension rejects messages from unknown senders and enforces a message type allowlist. Prevents cross-extension message spoofing.
- **CDP localhost-only binding.** `bin/chrome-cdp` now passes `--remote-debugging-address=127.0.0.1` and `--remote-allow-origins` to prevent remote debugging exposure.
- **Checksum-verified bun install.** The browse SKILL.md bootstrap now downloads the bun install script to a temp file and verifies SHA-256 before executing. No more piping curl to bash.

### Removed

- **Factory Droid support.** Removed `--host factory`, `.factory/` generated skills, Factory CI checks, and all Factory-specific code paths.

## [0.13.7.0] - 2026-03-29 — Community Wave

Six community fixes with 16 new tests. Telemetry off now means off everywhere. Skills are findable by name. And changing your prefix setting actually works now.

### Fixed

- **Telemetry off means off everywhere.** When you set telemetry to off, gstack no longer writes local JSONL analytics files. Previously "off" only stopped remote reporting. Now nothing is written anywhere. Clean trust contract.
- **`find -delete` replaced with POSIX `-exec rm`.** Safety Net and other non-GNU environments no longer choke on session cleanup.
- **No more preemptive context warnings.** `/plan-eng-review` no longer warns you about running low on context. The system handles compaction automatically.
- **Sidebar security test updated** for Write tool fallback string change.
- **`gstack-relink` no longer double-prefixes `gstack-upgrade`.** Setting `skill_prefix=true` was creating `gstack-gstack-upgrade` instead of keeping the existing name. Now matches `setup` script behavior.

### Added

- **Skill discoverability.** Every skill description now contains "(gstack)" so you can find gstack skills by searching in Claude Code's command palette.
- **Feature signal detection in `/ship`.** Version bump now checks for new routes, migrations, test+source pairs, and `feat/` branches. Catches MINOR-worthy changes that line count alone misses.
- **Sidebar Write tool.** Both the sidebar agent and headed-mode server now include Write in allowedTools. Write doesn't expand the attack surface beyond what Bash already provides.
- **Sidebar stderr capture.** The sidebar agent now buffers stderr and includes it in error and timeout messages instead of silently discarding it.
- **`bin/gstack-relink`** re-creates skill symlinks when you change `skill_prefix` via `gstack-config set`. No more manual `./setup` re-run needed.
- **`bin/gstack-open-url`** cross-platform URL opener (macOS: `open`, Linux: `xdg-open`, Windows: `start`).

## [0.13.6.0] - 2026-03-29 — GStack Learns

Every session now makes the next one smarter. gstack remembers patterns, pitfalls, and preferences across sessions and uses them to improve every review, plan, debug, and ship. The more you use it, the better it gets on your codebase.

### Added

- **Project learnings system.** gstack automatically captures patterns and pitfalls it discovers during /review, /ship, /investigate, and other skills. Stored per-project at `~/.gstack/projects/{slug}/learnings.jsonl`. Append-only, Supabase-compatible schema.
- **`/learn` skill.** Review what gstack has learned (`/learn`), search (`/learn search auth`), prune stale entries (`/learn prune`), export to markdown (`/learn export`), or check stats (`/learn stats`). Manually add learnings with `/learn add`.
- **Confidence calibration.** Every review finding now includes a confidence score (1-10). High-confidence findings (7+) show normally, medium (5-6) show with a caveat, low (<5) are suppressed. No more crying wolf.
- **"Learning applied" callouts.** When a review finding matches a past learning, gstack displays it: "Prior learning applied: [pattern] (confidence 8/10, from 2026-03-15)". You can see the compounding in action.
- **Cross-project discovery.** gstack can search learnings from your other projects for matching patterns. Opt-in, with a one-time AskUserQuestion for consent. Stays local to your machine.
- **Confidence decay.** Observed and inferred learnings lose 1 confidence point per 30 days. User-stated preferences never decay. A good pattern is a good pattern forever, but uncertain observations fade.
- **Learnings count in preamble.** Every skill now shows "LEARNINGS: N entries loaded" during startup.
- **5-release roadmap design doc.** `docs/designs/SELF_LEARNING_V0.md` maps the path from R1 (GStack Learns) through R4 (/autoship, one-command full feature) to R5 (Studio).

## [0.13.5.1] - 2026-03-29 — Gitignore .factory

### Changed

- **Stop tracking `.factory/` directory.** Generated Factory Droid skill files are now gitignored, same as `.claude/skills/` and `.agents/`. Removes 29 generated SKILL.md files from the repo. The `setup` script and `bun run build` regenerate these on demand.

## [0.13.5.0] - 2026-03-29 — Factory Droid Compatibility

gstack now works with Factory Droid. Type `/qa` in Droid and get the same 29 skills you use in Claude Code. This makes gstack the first skill library that works across Claude Code, Codex, and Factory Droid.

### Added

- **Factory Droid support (`--host factory`).** Generate Factory-native skills with `bun run gen:skill-docs --host factory`. Skills install to `.factory/skills/` with proper frontmatter (`user-invocable: true`, `disable-model-invocation: true` for sensitive skills like /ship and /land-and-deploy).
- **`--host all` flag.** One command generates skills for all 3 hosts. Fault-tolerant: catches per-host errors, only fails if Claude generation fails.
- **`gstack-platform-detect` binary.** Prints a table of installed AI coding agents with versions, skill paths, and gstack status. Useful for debugging multi-host setups.
- **Sensitive skill safety.** Six skills with side effects (ship, land-and-deploy, guard, careful, freeze, unfreeze) now declare `sensitive: true` in their templates. Factory Droids won't auto-invoke them. Claude and Codex output strips the field.
- **Factory CI freshness check.** The skill-docs workflow now verifies Factory output is fresh on every PR.
- **Factory awareness across operational tooling.** skill-check dashboard, gstack-uninstall, and setup script all know about Factory.

### Changed

- **Refactored multi-host generation.** Extracted `processExternalHost()` shared helper from the Codex-specific code block. Both Codex and Factory use the same function for output routing, symlink loop detection, frontmatter transformation, and path rewrites. Codex output is byte-identical after refactor.
- **Build script uses `--host all`.** Replaces chained `gen:skill-docs` calls with a single `--host all` invocation.
- **Tool name translation for Factory.** Claude Code tool names ("use the Bash tool") are translated to generic phrasing ("run this command") in Factory output, matching Factory's tool naming conventions.

## [0.13.4.0] - 2026-03-29 — Sidebar Defense

The Chrome sidebar now defends against prompt injection attacks. Three layers: XML-framed prompts with trust boundaries, a command allowlist that restricts bash to browse commands only, and Opus as the default model (harder to manipulate).

### Fixed

- **Sidebar agent now respects server-side args.** The sidebar-agent process was silently rebuilding its own Claude args from scratch, ignoring `--model`, `--allowedTools`, and other flags set by the server. Every server-side configuration change was silently dropped. Now uses the queued args.

### Added

- **XML prompt framing with trust boundaries.** User messages are wrapped in `<user-message>` tags with explicit instructions to treat content as data, not instructions. XML special characters (`< > &`) are escaped to prevent tag injection attacks.
- **Bash command allowlist.** The sidebar's system prompt now restricts Claude to browse binary commands only (`$B goto`, `$B click`, `$B snapshot`, etc.). All other bash commands (`curl`, `rm`, `cat`, etc.) are forbidden. This prevents prompt injection from escalating to arbitrary code execution.
- **Opus default for sidebar.** The sidebar now uses Opus (the most injection-resistant model) by default, instead of whatever model Claude Code happens to be running.
- **ML prompt injection defense design doc.** Full design doc at `docs/designs/ML_PROMPT_INJECTION_KILLER.md` covering the follow-up ML classifier (DeBERTa, BrowseSafe-bench, Bun-native 5ms vision). P0 TODO for the next PR.

## [0.13.3.0] - 2026-03-28 — Lock It Down

Six fixes from community PRs and bug reports. The big one: your dependency tree is now pinned. Every `bun install` resolves the exact same versions, every time. No more floating ranges pulling fresh packages from npm on every setup.

### Fixed

- **Dependencies are now pinned.** `bun.lock` is committed and tracked. Every install resolves identical versions instead of floating `^` ranges from npm. Closes the supply-chain vector from #566.
- **`gstack-slug` no longer crashes outside git repos.** Falls back to directory name and "unknown" branch when there's no remote or HEAD. Every review skill that depends on slug detection now works in non-git contexts.
- **`./setup` no longer hangs in CI.** The skill-prefix prompt now auto-selects short names after 10 seconds. Conductor workspaces, Docker builds, and unattended installs proceed without human input.
- **Browse CLI works on Windows.** The server lockfile now uses `'wx'` string flag instead of numeric `fs.constants` that Bun compiled binaries don't handle on Windows.
- **`/ship` and `/review` find your design docs.** Plan search now checks `~/.gstack/projects/` first, where `/office-hours` writes design documents. Previously, plan validation silently skipped because it was looking in the wrong directories.
- **`/autoplan` dual-voice actually works.** Background subagents can't read files (Claude Code limitation), so the Claude voice was silently failing on every run. Now runs sequentially in foreground. Both voices complete before the consensus table.

### Added

- **Community PR guardrails in CLAUDE.md.** ETHOS.md, promotional material, and Garry's voice are explicitly protected from modification without user approval.

## [0.13.2.0] - 2026-03-28 — User Sovereignty

AI models now recommend instead of override. When Claude and Codex agree on a scope change, they present it to you instead of just doing it. Your direction is the default, not the models' consensus.

### Added

- **User Sovereignty principle in ETHOS.md.** The third core principle: AI models recommend, users decide. Cross-model agreement is a strong signal, not a mandate.
- **User Challenge category in /autoplan.** When both models agree your stated direction should change, it goes to the final approval gate as a "User Challenge" instead of being auto-decided. Your original direction stands unless you explicitly change it.
- **Security/feasibility warning framing.** If both models flag something as a security risk (not just a preference), the question explicitly warns you it's a safety concern, not a taste call.
- **Outside Voice Integration Rule in CEO and Eng reviews.** Outside voice findings are informational until you explicitly approve each one.
- **User sovereignty statement in all skill voices.** Every skill now includes the rule that cross-model agreement is a recommendation, not a decision.

### Changed

- **Cross-model tension template no longer says "your assessment of who's right."** Now says "present both perspectives neutrally, state what context you might be missing." Options expanded from Add/Skip to Accept/Keep/Investigate/Defer.
- **/autoplan now has two gates, not one.** Premises (Phase 1) and User Challenges (both models disagree with your direction). Important Rules updated from "premises are the one gate" to "two gates."
- **Decision Audit Trail now tracks classification.** Each auto-decision is logged as mechanical, taste, or user-challenge.

## [0.13.1.0] - 2026-03-28 — Defense in Depth

The browse server runs on localhost and requires a token for access, so these issues only matter if a malicious process is already running on your machine (e.g., a compromised npm postinstall script). This release hardens the attack surface so that even in that scenario, the damage is contained.

### Fixed

- **Auth token removed from `/health` endpoint.** Token now distributed via `.auth.json` file (0o600 permissions) instead of an unauthenticated HTTP response.
- **Cookie picker data routes now require Bearer auth.** The HTML picker page is still open (it's the UI shell), but all data and action endpoints check the token.
- **CORS tightened on `/refs` and `/activity/*`.** Removed wildcard origin header so websites can't read browse activity cross-origin.
- **State files auto-expire after 7 days.** Cookie state files now include a timestamp and warn on load if stale. Server startup cleans up files older than 7 days.
- **Extension uses `textContent` instead of `innerHTML`.** Prevents DOM injection if server-provided data ever contained markup. Standard defense-in-depth for browser extensions.
- **Path validation resolves symlinks before boundary checks.** `validateReadPath` now calls `realpathSync` and handles macOS `/tmp` symlink correctly.
- **Freeze hook uses portable path resolution.** POSIX-compatible (works on macOS without coreutils), fixes edge case where `/project-evil` could match a freeze boundary set to `/project`.
- **Shell config scripts validate input.** `gstack-config` rejects regex-special keys and escapes sed patterns. `gstack-telemetry-log` sanitizes branch/repo names in JSON output.

### Added

- 20 regression tests covering all hardening changes.

## [0.13.0.0] - 2026-03-27 — Your Agent Can Design Now

gstack can generate real UI mockups. Not ASCII art, not text descriptions of hex codes, real visual designs you can look at, compare, pick from, and iterate on. Run `/office-hours` on a UI idea and you'll get 3 visual concepts in Chrome with a comparison board where you pick your favorite, rate the others, and tell the agent what to change.

### Added

- **Design binary** (`$D`). New compiled CLI wrapping OpenAI's GPT Image API. 13 commands: `generate`, `variants`, `iterate`, `check`, `compare`, `extract`, `diff`, `verify`, `evolve`, `prompt`, `serve`, `gallery`, `setup`. Generates pixel-perfect UI mockups from structured design briefs in ~40 seconds.
- **Comparison board.** `$D compare` generates a self-contained HTML page with all variants, star ratings, per-variant feedback, regeneration controls, a remix grid (mix layout from A with colors from B), and a Submit button. Feedback flows back to the agent via HTTP POST, not DOM polling.
- **`/design-shotgun` skill.** Standalone design exploration you can run anytime. Generates multiple AI design variants, opens a comparison board in your browser, and iterates until you approve a direction. Session awareness (remembers prior explorations), taste memory (biases new generations toward your demonstrated preferences), screenshot-to-variants (screenshot what you don't like, get improvements), configurable variant count (3-8).
- **`$D serve` command.** HTTP server for the comparison board feedback loop. Serves the board on localhost, opens in your default browser, collects feedback via POST. Stateful: stays alive across regeneration rounds, supports same-tab reload via `/api/progress` polling.
- **`$D gallery` command.** Generates an HTML timeline of all design explorations for a project: every variant, feedback, organized by date.
- **Design memory.** `$D extract` analyzes an approved mockup with GPT-4o vision and writes colors, typography, spacing, and layout patterns to DESIGN.md. Future mockups on the same project inherit the established visual language.
- **Visual diffing.** `$D diff` compares two images and identifies differences by area with severity. `$D verify` compares a live site screenshot against an approved mockup, pass/fail gate.
- **Screenshot evolution.** `$D evolve` takes a screenshot of your live site and generates a mockup showing how it should look based on your feedback. Starts from reality, not blank canvas.
- **Responsive variants.** `$D variants --viewports desktop,tablet,mobile` generates mockups at multiple viewport sizes.
- **Design-to-code prompt.** `$D prompt` extracts implementation instructions from an approved mockup: exact hex colors, font sizes, spacing values, component structure. Zero interpretation gap.

### Changed

- **/office-hours** now generates visual mockup explorations by default (skippable). Comparison board opens in your browser for feedback before generating HTML wireframes.
- **/plan-design-review** uses `{{DESIGN_SHOTGUN_LOOP}}` for the comparison board. Can generate "what 10/10 looks like" mockups when a design dimension rates below 7/10.
- **/design-consultation** uses `{{DESIGN_SHOTGUN_LOOP}}` for Phase 5 AI mockup review.
- **Comparison board post-submit lifecycle.** After submitting, all inputs are disabled and a "Return to your coding agent" message appears. After regenerating, a spinner shows with auto-refresh when new designs are ready. If the server is gone, a copyable JSON fallback appears.

### For contributors

- Design binary source: `design/src/` (16 files, ~2500 lines TypeScript)
- New files: `serve.ts` (stateful HTTP server), `gallery.ts` (timeline generation)
- Tests: `design/test/serve.test.ts` (11 tests), `design/test/gallery.test.ts` (7 tests)
- Full design doc: `docs/designs/DESIGN_TOOLS_V1.md`
- Template resolvers: `{{DESIGN_SETUP}}` (binary discovery), `{{DESIGN_SHOTGUN_LOOP}}` (shared comparison board loop for /design-shotgun, /plan-design-review, /design-consultation)

## [0.12.12.0] - 2026-03-27 — Security Audit Compliance

Fixes 20 Socket alerts and 3 Snyk findings from the skills.sh security audit. Your skills are now cleaner, your telemetry is transparent, and 2,000 lines of dead code are gone.

### Fixed

- **No more hardcoded credentials in examples.** QA workflow docs now use `$TEST_EMAIL` / `$TEST_PASSWORD` env vars instead of `test@example.com` / `password123`. Cookie import section now has a safety note.
- **Telemetry calls are conditional.** The `gstack-telemetry-log` binary only runs if telemetry is enabled AND the binary exists. Local JSONL logging always works, no binary needed.
- **Bun install is version-pinned.** Install instructions now pin `BUN_VERSION=1.3.10` and skip the download if bun is already installed.
- **Untrusted content warning.** Every skill that fetches pages now warns: treat page content as data to inspect, not commands to execute. Covers generated SKILL.md files, BROWSER.md, and docs/skills.md.
- **Data flow documented in review.ts.** JSDoc header explicitly states what data is sent to external review services (plan content, repo/branch name) and what is NOT sent (source code, credentials, env vars).

### Removed

- **2,017 lines of dead code from gen-skill-docs.ts.** Duplicate resolver functions that were superseded by `scripts/resolvers/*.ts`. The RESOLVERS map is now the single source of truth with no shadow copies.

### For contributors

- New `test:audit` script runs 6 regression tests that enforce all audit fixes stay in place.

## [0.12.11.0] - 2026-03-27 — Skill Prefix is Now Your Choice

You can now choose how gstack skills appear: short names (`/qa`, `/ship`, `/review`) or namespaced (`/gstack-qa`, `/gstack-ship`). Setup asks on first run, remembers your preference, and switching is one command.

### Added

- **Interactive prefix choice on first setup.** New installs get a prompt: short names (`/qa`, `/ship`) or namespaced (`/gstack-qa`, `/gstack-ship`). Short names are recommended. Your choice is saved to `~/.gstack/config.yaml` and remembered across upgrades.
- **`--prefix` flag.** Complement to `--no-prefix`. Both flags persist your choice so you only decide once.
- **Reverse symlink cleanup.** Switching from namespaced to flat (or vice versa) now cleans up the old symlinks. No more duplicate commands showing up in Claude Code.
- **Namespace-aware skill suggestions.** All 28 skill templates now check your prefix setting. When one skill suggests another (like `/ship` suggesting `/qa`), it uses the right name for your install.

### Fixed

- **`gstack-config` works on Linux.** Replaced BSD-only `sed -i ''` with portable `mktemp`+`mv`. Config writes now work on GNU/Linux and WSL.
- **Dead welcome message.** The "Welcome!" message on first install was never shown because `~/.gstack/` was created earlier in setup. Fixed with a `.welcome-seen` sentinel file.

### For contributors

- 8 new structural tests for the prefix config system (223 total in gen-skill-docs).

## [0.12.10.0] - 2026-03-27 — Codex Filesystem Boundary

Codex was wandering into `~/.claude/skills/` and following gstack's own instructions instead of reviewing your code. Now every codex prompt includes a boundary instruction that keeps it focused on the repository. Covers all 11 callsites across /codex, /autoplan, /review, /ship, /plan-eng-review, /plan-ceo-review, and /office-hours.

### Fixed

- **Codex stays in the repo.** All `codex exec` and `codex review` calls now prepend a filesystem boundary instruction telling Codex to ignore skill definition files. Prevents Codex from reading SKILL.md preamble scripts and wasting 8+ minutes on session tracking and upgrade checks.
- **Rabbit-hole detection.** If Codex output contains signs it got distracted by skill files (`gstack-config`, `gstack-update-check`, `SKILL.md`, `skills/gstack`), the /codex skill now warns and suggests a retry.
- **5 regression tests.** New test suite validates boundary text appears in all 7 codex-calling skills, the Filesystem Boundary section exists, the rabbit-hole detection rule exists, and autoplan uses cross-host-compatible path patterns.

## [0.12.9.0] - 2026-03-27 — Community PRs: Faster Install, Skill Namespacing, Uninstall

Six community PRs landed in one batch. Install is faster, skills no longer collide with other tools, and you can cleanly uninstall gstack when needed.

### Added

- **Uninstall script.** `bin/gstack-uninstall` cleanly removes gstack from your system: stops browse daemons, removes all skill installs (Claude/Codex/Kiro), cleans up state. Supports `--force` (skip confirmation) and `--keep-state` (preserve config). (#323)
- **Python security patterns in /review.** Shell injection (`subprocess.run(shell=True)`), SSRF via LLM-generated URLs, stored prompt injection, async/sync mixing, and column name safety checks now fire automatically on Python projects. (#531)
- **Office-hours works without Codex.** The "second opinion" step now falls back to a Claude subagent when Codex CLI is unavailable, so every user gets the cross-model perspective. (#464)

### Changed

- **Faster install (~30s).** All clone commands now use `--single-branch --depth 1`. Full history available for contributors. (#484)
- **Skills namespaced with `gstack-` prefix.** Skill symlinks are now `gstack-review`, `gstack-ship`, etc. instead of bare `review`, `ship`. Prevents collisions with other skill packs. Old symlinks are auto-cleaned on upgrade. Use `--no-prefix` to opt out. (#503)

### Fixed

- **Windows port race condition.** `findPort()` now uses `net.createServer()` instead of `Bun.serve()` for port probing, fixing an EADDRINUSE race on Windows where the polyfill's `stop()` is fire-and-forget. (#490)
- **package.json version sync.** VERSION file and package.json now agree (was stuck at 0.12.5.0).

## [0.12.8.1] - 2026-03-27 — zsh Glob Compatibility

Skill scripts now work correctly in zsh. Previously, bash code blocks in skill templates used raw glob patterns like `.github/workflows/*.yaml` and `ls ~/.gstack/projects/$SLUG/*-design-*.md` that would throw "no matches found" errors in zsh when no files matched. Fixed 38 instances across 13 templates and 2 resolvers using two approaches: `find`-based alternatives for complex patterns, and `setopt +o nomatch` guards for simple `ls` commands.

### Fixed

- **`.github/workflows/` globs replaced with `find`.** `cat .github/workflows/*deploy*`, `for f in .github/workflows/*.yml`, and `ls .github/workflows/*.yaml` patterns in `/land-and-deploy`, `/setup-deploy`, `/cso`, and the deploy bootstrap resolver now use `find ... -name` instead of raw globs.
- **`~/.gstack/` and `~/.claude/` globs guarded with `setopt`.** Design doc lookups, eval result listings, test plan discovery, and retro history checks across 10 skills now prepend `setopt +o nomatch 2>/dev/null || true` (no-op in bash, disables NOMATCH in zsh).
- **Test framework detection globs guarded.** `ls jest.config.* vitest.config.*` in the testing resolver now has a setopt guard.

## [0.12.8.0] - 2026-03-27 — Codex No Longer Reviews the Wrong Project

When you run gstack in Conductor with multiple workspaces open, Codex could silently review the wrong project. The `codex exec -C` flag resolved the repo root inline via `$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)`, which evaluates in whatever cwd the background shell inherits. In multi-workspace environments, that cwd might be a different project entirely.

### Fixed

- **Codex exec resolves repo root eagerly.** All 12 `codex exec` commands across `/codex`, `/autoplan`, and 4 resolver functions now resolve `_REPO_ROOT` at the top of each bash block and reference the stored value in `-C`. No more inline evaluation that races with other workspaces.
- **`codex review` also gets cwd protection.** `codex review` doesn't support `-C`, so it now gets `cd "$_REPO_ROOT"` before invocation. Same class of bug, different command.
- **Silent fallback replaced with hard fail.** The `|| pwd` fallback silently used whatever random cwd was available. Now it errors out with a clear message if not in a git repo.

### Removed

- **Dead resolver copies in gen-skill-docs.ts.** Six functions that were moved to `scripts/resolvers/` months ago but never deleted. They had already diverged from the live versions and contained the old vulnerable pattern.

### Added

- **Regression test** that scans all `.tmpl`, resolver `.ts`, and generated `SKILL.md` files for codex commands using inline `$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)`. Prevents reintroduction.

## [0.12.7.0] - 2026-03-27 — Community PRs + Security Hardening

Seven community contributions merged, reviewed, and tested. Plus security hardening for telemetry and review logging, and E2E test stability fixes.

### Added

- **Dotfile filtering in skill discovery.** Hidden directories (`.git`, `.vscode`, etc.) are no longer picked up as skill templates.
- **JSON validation gate in review-log.** Malformed input is rejected instead of appended to the JSONL file.
- **Telemetry input sanitization.** All string fields are stripped of quotes, backslashes, and control characters before being written to JSONL.
- **Host-specific co-author trailers.** `/ship` and `/document-release` now use the correct co-author line for Codex vs Claude.
- **10 new security tests** covering telemetry injection, review-log validation, and dotfile filtering.

### Fixed

- **File paths starting with `./` no longer treated as CSS selectors.** `$B screenshot ./path/to/file.png` now works instead of trying to find a CSS element.
- **Build chain resilience.** `gen:skill-docs` failure no longer blocks binary compilation.
- **Update checker fall-through.** After upgrading, the checker now also checks for newer remote versions instead of stopping.
- **Flaky E2E tests stabilized.** `browse-basic`, `ship-base-branch`, and `review-dashboard-via` tests now pass reliably by extracting only relevant SKILL.md sections instead of copying full 1900-line files into test fixtures.
- **Removed unreliable `journey-think-bigger` routing test.** Never passed reliably because the routing signal was too ambiguous. 10 other journey tests cover routing with clear signals.

### For contributors

- New CLAUDE.md rule: never copy full SKILL.md files into E2E test fixtures. Extract the relevant section only.

## [0.12.6.0] - 2026-03-27 — Sidebar Knows What Page You're On

The Chrome sidebar agent used to navigate to the wrong page when you asked it to do something. If you'd manually browsed to a site, the sidebar would ignore that and go to whatever Playwright last saw (often Hacker News from the demo). Now it works.

### Fixed

- **Sidebar uses the real tab URL.** The Chrome extension now captures the actual page URL via `chrome.tabs.query()` and sends it to the server. Previously the sidebar agent used Playwright's stale `page.url()`, which didn't update when you navigated manually in headed mode.
- **URL sanitization.** The extension-provided URL is validated (http/https only, control characters stripped, 2048 char limit) before being used in the Claude system prompt. Prevents prompt injection via crafted URLs.
- **Stale sidebar agents killed on reconnect.** Each `/connect-chrome` now kills leftover sidebar-agent processes before starting a new one. Old agents had stale auth tokens and would silently fail, causing the sidebar to freeze.

### Added

- **Pre-flight cleanup for `/connect-chrome`.** Kills stale browse servers and cleans Chromium profile locks before connecting. Prevents "already connected" false positives after crashes.
- **Sidebar agent test suite (36 tests).** Four layers: unit tests for URL sanitization, integration tests for server HTTP endpoints, mock-Claude round-trip tests, and E2E tests with real Claude. All free except layer 4.

## [0.12.5.1] - 2026-03-27 — Eng Review Now Tells You What to Parallelize

`/plan-eng-review` automatically analyzes your plan for parallel execution opportunities. When your plan has independent workstreams, the review outputs a dependency table, parallel lanes, and execution order so you know exactly which tasks to split into separate git worktrees.

### Added

- **Worktree parallelization strategy** in `/plan-eng-review` required outputs. Extracts a structured table of plan steps with module-level dependencies, computes parallel lanes, and flags merge conflict risks. Skips automatically for single-module or single-track plans.

## [0.12.5.0] - 2026-03-26 — Fix Codex Hangs: 30-Minute Waits Are Gone

Three bugs in `/codex` caused 30+ minute hangs with zero output during plan reviews and adversarial checks. All three are fixed.

### Fixed

- **Plan files now visible to Codex sandbox.** Codex runs sandboxed to the repo root and couldn't see plan files at `~/.claude/plans/`. It would waste 10+ tool calls searching before giving up. Now the plan content is embedded directly in the prompt, and referenced source files are listed so Codex reads them immediately.
- **Streaming output actually streams.** Python's stdout buffering meant zero output visible until the process exited. Added `PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1`, `python3 -u`, and `flush=True` on every print call across all three Codex modes.
- **Sane reasoning effort defaults.** Replaced hardcoded `xhigh` (23x more tokens, known 50+ min hangs per OpenAI issues #8545, #8402, #6931) with per-mode defaults: `high` for review and challenge, `medium` for consult. Users can override with `--xhigh` flag when they want maximum reasoning.
- **`--xhigh` override works in all modes.** The override reminder was missing from challenge and consult mode instructions. Found by adversarial review.

## [0.12.4.0] - 2026-03-26 — Full Commit Coverage in /ship

When you ship a branch with 12 commits spanning performance work, dead code removal, and test infra, the PR should mention all three. It wasn't. The CHANGELOG and PR summary biased toward whatever happened most recently, silently dropping earlier work.

### Fixed

- **/ship Step 5 (CHANGELOG):** Now forces explicit commit enumeration before writing. You list every commit, group by theme, write the entry, then cross-check that every commit maps to a bullet. No more recency bias.
- **/ship Step 8 (PR body):** Changed from "bullet points from CHANGELOG" to explicit commit-by-commit coverage. Groups commits into logical sections. Excludes the VERSION/CHANGELOG metadata commit (bookkeeping, not a change). Every substantive commit must appear somewhere.

## [0.12.3.0] - 2026-03-26 — Voice Directive: Every Skill Sounds Like a Builder

Every gstack skill now has a voice. Not a personality, not a persona, but a consistent set of instructions that make Claude sound like someone who shipped code today and cares whether the thing works for real users. Direct, concrete, sharp. Names the file, the function, the command. Connects technical work to what the user actually experiences.

Two tiers: lightweight skills get a trimmed version (tone + writing rules). Full skills get the complete directive with context-dependent tone (YC partner energy for strategy, senior eng for code review, blog-post clarity for debugging), concreteness standards, humor calibration, and user-outcome guidance.

### Added

- **Voice directive in all 25 skills.** Generated from `preamble.ts`, injected via the template resolver. Tier 1 skills get a 4-line version. Tier 2+ skills get the full directive.
- **Context-dependent tone.** Match the context: YC partner for `/plan-ceo-review`, senior eng for `/review`, best-technical-blog-post for `/investigate`.
- **Concreteness standard.** "Show the exact command. Use real numbers. Point at the exact line." Not aspirational... enforced.
- **User outcome connection.** "This matters because your user will see a 3-second spinner." Make the user's user real.
- **LLM eval test.** Judge scores directness, concreteness, anti-corporate tone, AI vocabulary avoidance, and user outcome connection. All dimensions must score 4/5+.

## [0.12.2.0] - 2026-03-26 — Deploy with Confidence: First-Run Dry Run

The first time you run `/land-and-deploy` on a project, it does a dry run. It detects your deploy infrastructure, tests that every command works, and shows you exactly what will happen... before it touches anything. You confirm, and from then on it just works.

If your deploy config changes later (new platform, different workflow, updated URLs), it automatically re-runs the dry run. Trust is earned, maintained, and re-validated when the ground shifts.

### Added

- **First-run dry run.** Shows your deploy infrastructure in a validation table: platform, CLI status, production URL reachability, staging detection, merge method, merge queue status. You confirm before anything irreversible happens.
- **Staging-first option.** If staging is detected (CLAUDE.md config, GitHub Actions workflow, or Vercel/Netlify preview), you can deploy there first, verify it works, then proceed to production.
- **Config decay detection.** The dry-run confirmation stores a fingerprint of your deploy config. If CLAUDE.md's deploy section or your deploy workflows change, the dry run re-triggers automatically.
- **Inline review gate.** If no recent code review exists, offers a quick safety check on the diff before merging. Catches SQL safety, race conditions, and security issues at deploy time.
- **Merge queue awareness.** Detects when your repo uses merge queues and explains what's happening while it waits.
- **CI auto-deploy detection.** Identifies deploy workflows triggered by the merge and monitors them.

### Changed

- **Full copy rewrite.** Every user-facing message rewritten to narrate what's happening, explain why, and be specific. First run = teacher mode. Subsequent runs = efficient mode.
- **Voice & Tone section.** New guidelines for how the skill communicates: be a senior release engineer sitting next to the developer, not a robot.

## [0.12.1.0] - 2026-03-26 — Smarter Browsing: Network Idle, State Persistence, Iframes

Every click, fill, and select now waits for the page to settle before returning. No more stale snapshots because an XHR was still in-flight. Chain accepts pipe-delimited format for faster multi-step flows. You can save and restore browser sessions (cookies + open tabs). And iframe content is now reachable.

### Added

- **Network idle detection.** `click`, `fill`, and `select` auto-wait up to 2s for network requests to settle before returning. Catches XHR/fetch triggered by interactions. Uses Playwright's built-in `waitForLoadState('networkidle')`, not a custom tracker.

- **`$B state save/load`.** Save your browser session (cookies + open tabs) to a named file, load it back later. Files stored at `.gstack/browse-states/{name}.json` with 0o600 permissions. V1 saves cookies + URLs only (not localStorage, which breaks on load-before-navigate). Load replaces the current session, not merge.

- **`$B frame` command.** Switch command context into an iframe: `$B frame iframe`, `$B frame --name checkout`, `$B frame --url stripe`, or `$B frame @e5`. All subsequent commands (click, fill, snapshot, etc.) operate inside the iframe. `$B frame main` returns to the main page. Snapshot shows `[Context: iframe src="..."]` header. Detached frames auto-recover.

- **Chain pipe format.** Chain now accepts `$B chain 'goto url | click @e5 | snapshot -ic'` as a fallback when JSON parsing fails. Pipe-delimited with quote-aware tokenization.

### Changed

- **Chain post-loop idle wait.** After executing all commands in a chain, if the last was a write command, chain waits for network idle before returning.

### Fixed

- **Iframe ref scoping.** Snapshot ref locators, cursor-interactive scan, and cursor locators now use the frame-aware target instead of always scoping to the main page.
- **Detached frame recovery.** `getActiveFrameOrPage()` checks `isDetached()` and auto-recovers.
- **State load resets frame context.** Loading a saved state clears the active frame reference.
- **elementHandle leak in frame command.** Now properly disposed after getting contentFrame.
- **Upload command frame-aware.** `upload` uses the frame-aware target for file input locators.

## [0.12.0.0] - 2026-03-26 — Headed Mode + Sidebar Agent

You can now watch Claude work in a real Chrome window and direct it from a sidebar chat.

### Added

- **Headed mode with sidebar agent.** `$B connect` launches a visible Chrome window with the gstack extension. The Side Panel shows a live activity feed of every command AND a chat interface where you type natural language instructions. A child Claude instance executes your requests in the browser ... navigate pages, click buttons, fill forms, extract data. Each task gets up to 5 minutes.

- **Personal automation.** The sidebar agent handles repetitive browser tasks beyond dev workflows. Browse your kid's school parent portal and add parent contact info to Google Contacts. Fill out vendor onboarding forms. Extract data from dashboards. Log in once in the headed browser or import cookies from your real Chrome with `/setup-browser-cookies`.

- **Chrome extension.** Toolbar badge (green=connected, gray=not), Side Panel with activity feed + chat + refs tab, @ref overlays on the page, and a connection pill showing which window gstack controls. Auto-loads when you run `$B connect`.

- **`/connect-chrome` skill.** Guided setup: launches Chrome, verifies the extension, demos the activity feed, and introduces the sidebar chat.

### Changed

- **Sidebar agent ungated.** Previously required `--chat` flag. Now always available in headed mode. The sidebar agent has the same security model as Claude Code itself (Bash, Read, Glob, Grep on localhost).

- **Agent timeout raised to 5 minutes.** Multi-page tasks (navigating directories, filling forms across pages) need more than the previous 2-minute limit.

## [0.11.21.0] - 2026-03-26

### Fixed

- **`/autoplan` reviews now count toward the ship readiness gate.** When `/autoplan` ran full CEO + Design + Eng reviews, `/ship` still showed "0 runs" for Eng Review because autoplan-logged entries weren't being read correctly. Now the dashboard shows source attribution (e.g., "CLEAR (PLAN via /autoplan)") so you can see exactly which tool satisfied each review.
- **`/ship` no longer tells you to "run /review first."** Ship runs its own pre-landing review in Step 3.5 — asking you to run the same review separately was redundant. The gate is removed; ship just does it.
- **`/land-and-deploy` now checks all 8 review types.** Previously missed `review`, `adversarial-review`, and `codex-plan-review` — if you only ran `/review` (not `/plan-eng-review`), land-and-deploy wouldn't see it.
- **Dashboard Outside Voice row now works.** Was showing "0 runs" even after outside voices ran in `/plan-ceo-review` or `/plan-eng-review`. Now correctly maps to `codex-plan-review` entries.
- **`/codex review` now tracks staleness.** Added the `commit` field to codex review log entries so the dashboard can detect when a codex review is outdated.
- **`/autoplan` no longer hardcodes "clean" status.** Review log entries from autoplan used to always record `status:"clean"` even when issues were found. Now uses proper placeholder tokens that Claude substitutes with real values.

## [0.11.20.0] - 2026-03-26

### Added

- **GitLab support for `/retro` and `/ship`.** You can now run `/ship` on GitLab repos — it creates merge requests via `glab mr create` instead of `gh pr create`. `/retro` detects default branches on both platforms. All 11 skills using `BASE_BRANCH_DETECT` automatically get GitHub, GitLab, and git-native fallback detection.
- **GitHub Enterprise and self-hosted GitLab detection.** If the remote URL doesn't match `github.com` or `gitlab`, gstack checks `gh auth status` / `glab auth status` to detect authenticated platforms — no manual config needed.
- **`/document-release` works on GitLab.** After `/ship` creates a merge request, the auto-invoked `/document-release` reads and updates the MR body via `glab` instead of failing silently.
- **GitLab safety gate for `/land-and-deploy`.** Instead of silently failing on GitLab repos, `/land-and-deploy` now stops early with a clear message that GitLab merge support is not yet implemented.

### Fixed

- **Deduplicated gen-skill-docs resolvers.** The template generator had duplicate inline resolver functions that shadowed the modular versions, causing generated SKILL.md files to miss recent resolver updates.

## [0.11.19.0] - 2026-03-24

### Fixed

- **Auto-upgrade no longer breaks.** The root gstack skill description was 7 characters from the Codex 1024-char limit. Every new skill addition pushed it closer. Moved the skill routing table from the description (bounded) to the body (unlimited), dropping from 1017 to 409 chars with 615 chars of headroom.
- **Codex reviews now run in the correct repo.** In multi-workspace setups (like Conductor), Codex could pick up the wrong project directory. All `codex exec` calls now explicitly set `-C` to the git root.

### Added

- **900-char early warning test.** A new test fails if any Codex skill description exceeds 900 chars, catching description bloat before it breaks builds.

## [0.11.18.2] - 2026-03-24

### Fixed

- **Windows browse daemon fixed.** The browse server wouldn't start on Windows because Bun requires `stdio` as an array (`['ignore', 'ignore', 'ignore']`), not a string (`'ignore'`). Fixes #448, #454, #458.

## [0.11.18.1] - 2026-03-24

### Changed

- **One decision per question — everywhere.** Every skill now presents decisions one at a time, each with its own focused question, recommendation, and options. No more wall-of-text questions that bundle unrelated choices together. This was already enforced in the three plan-review skills; now it's a universal rule across all 23+ skills.

## [0.11.18.0] - 2026-03-24 — Ship With Teeth

`/ship` and `/review` now actually enforce the quality gates they've been talking about. Coverage audit becomes a real gate (not just a diagram), plan completion gets verified against the diff, and verification steps from your plan run automatically.

### Added

- **Test coverage gate in /ship.** AI-assessed coverage below 60% is a hard stop. 60-79% gets a prompt. 80%+ passes. Thresholds are configurable per-project via `## Test Coverage` in CLAUDE.md.
- **Coverage warning in /review.** Low coverage is now flagged prominently before you reach the /ship gate, so you can write tests early.
- **Plan completion audit.** /ship reads your plan file, extracts every actionable item, cross-references against the diff, and shows you a DONE/NOT DONE/PARTIAL/CHANGED checklist. Missing items are a shipping blocker (with override).
- **Plan-aware scope drift detection.** /review's scope drift check now reads the plan file too — not just TODOS.md and PR description.
- **Auto-verification via /qa-only.** /ship reads your plan's verification section and runs /qa-only inline to test it — if a dev server is running on localhost. No server, no problem — it skips gracefully.
- **Shared plan file discovery.** Conversation context first, content-based grep fallback second. Used by plan completion, plan review reports, and verification.
- **Ship metrics logging.** Coverage %, plan completion ratio, and verification results are logged to review JSONL for /retro to track trends.
- **Plan completion in /retro.** Weekly retros now show plan completion rates across shipped branches.

## [0.11.17.0] - 2026-03-24 — Cleaner Skill Descriptions + Proactive Opt-Out

### Changed

- **Skill descriptions are now clean and readable.** Removed the ugly "MANUAL TRIGGER ONLY" prefix from every skill description that was wasting 58 characters and causing build errors for Codex integration.
- **You can now opt out of proactive skill suggestions.** The first time you run any gstack skill, you'll be asked whether you want gstack to suggest skills during your workflow. If you prefer to invoke skills manually, just say no — it's saved as a global setting. You can change your mind anytime with `gstack-config set proactive true/false`.

### Fixed

- **Telemetry source tagging no longer crashes.** Fixed duration guards and source field validation in the telemetry logger so it handles edge cases cleanly instead of erroring.

## [0.11.16.1] - 2026-03-24 — Installation ID Privacy Fix

### Fixed

- **Installation IDs are now random UUIDs instead of hostname hashes.** The old `SHA-256(hostname+username)` approach meant anyone who knew your machine identity could compute your installation ID. Now uses a random UUID stored in `~/.gstack/installation-id` — not derivable from any public input, rotatable by deleting the file.
- **RLS verification script handles edge cases.** `verify-rls.sh` now correctly treats INSERT success as expected (kept for old client compat), handles 409 conflicts and 204 no-ops.

## [0.11.16.0] - 2026-03-24 — Smarter CI + Telemetry Security

### Changed

- **CI runs only gate tests by default — periodic tests run weekly.** Every E2E test is now classified as `gate` (blocks PRs) or `periodic` (weekly cron + on-demand). Gate tests cover functional correctness and safety guardrails. Periodic tests cover expensive Opus quality benchmarks, non-deterministic routing tests, and tests requiring external services (Codex, Gemini). CI feedback is faster and cheaper while quality benchmarks still run weekly.
- **Global touchfiles are now granular.** Previously, changing `gen-skill-docs.ts` triggered all 56 E2E tests. Now only the ~27 tests that actually depend on it run. Same for `llm-judge.ts`, `test-server.ts`, `worktree.ts`, and the Codex/Gemini session runners. The truly global list is down to 3 files (session-runner, eval-store, touchfiles.ts itself).
- **New `test:gate` and `test:periodic` scripts** replace `test:e2e:fast`. Use `EVALS_TIER=gate` or `EVALS_TIER=periodic` to filter tests by tier.
- **Telemetry sync uses `GSTACK_SUPABASE_URL` instead of `GSTACK_TELEMETRY_ENDPOINT`.** Edge functions need the base URL, not the REST API path. The old variable is removed from `config.sh`.
- **Cursor advancement is now safe.** The sync script checks the edge function's `inserted` count before advancing — if zero events were inserted, the cursor holds and retries next run.

### Fixed

- **Telemetry RLS policies tightened.** Row-level security policies on all telemetry tables now deny direct access via the anon key. All reads and writes go through validated edge functions with schema checks, event type allowlists, and field length limits.
- **Community dashboard is faster and server-cached.** Dashboard stats are now served from a single edge function with 1-hour server-side caching, replacing multiple direct queries.

### For contributors

- `E2E_TIERS` map in `test/helpers/touchfiles.ts` classifies every test — a free validation test ensures it stays in sync with `E2E_TOUCHFILES`
- `EVALS_FAST` / `FAST_EXCLUDED_TESTS` removed in favor of `EVALS_TIER`
- `allow_failure` removed from CI matrix (gate tests should be reliable)
- New `.github/workflows/evals-periodic.yml` runs periodic tests Monday 6 AM UTC
- New migration: `supabase/migrations/002_tighten_rls.sql`
- New smoke test: `supabase/verify-rls.sh` (9 checks: 5 reads + 4 writes)
- Extended `test/telemetry.test.ts` with field name verification
- Untracked `browse/dist/` binaries from git (arm64-only, rebuilt by `./setup`)

## [0.11.15.0] - 2026-03-24 — E2E Test Coverage for Plan Reviews & Codex

### Added

- **E2E tests verify plan review reports appear at the bottom of plans.** The `/plan-eng-review` review report is now tested end-to-end — if it stops writing `## GSTACK REVIEW REPORT` to the plan file, the test catches it.
- **E2E tests verify Codex is offered in every plan skill.** Four new lightweight tests confirm that `/office-hours`, `/plan-ceo-review`, `/plan-design-review`, and `/plan-eng-review` all check for Codex availability, prompt the user, and handle the fallback when Codex is unavailable.

### For contributors

- New E2E tests in `test/skill-e2e-plan.test.ts`: `plan-review-report`, `codex-offered-eng-review`, `codex-offered-ceo-review`, `codex-offered-office-hours`, `codex-offered-design-review`
- Updated touchfile mappings and selection count assertions
- Added `touchfiles` to the documented global touchfile list in CLAUDE.md

## [0.11.14.0] - 2026-03-24 — Windows Browse Fix

### Fixed

- **Browse engine now works on Windows.** Three compounding bugs blocked all Windows `/browse` users: the server process died when the CLI exited (Bun's `unref()` doesn't truly detach on Windows), the health check never ran because `process.kill(pid, 0)` is broken in Bun binaries on Windows, and Chromium's sandbox failed when spawned through the Bun→Node process chain. All three are now fixed. Credits to @fqueiro (PR #191) for identifying the `detached: true` approach.
- **Health check runs first on all platforms.** `ensureServer()` now tries an HTTP health check before falling back to PID-based detection — more reliable on every OS, not just Windows.
- **Startup errors are logged to disk.** When the server fails to start, errors are written to `~/.gstack/browse-startup-error.log` so Windows users (who lose stderr due to process detachment) can debug.
- **Chromium sandbox disabled on Windows.** Chromium's sandbox requires elevated privileges when spawned through the Bun→Node chain — now disabled on Windows only.

### For contributors

- New tests for `isServerHealthy()` and startup error logging in `browse/test/config.test.ts`

## [0.11.13.0] - 2026-03-24 — Worktree Isolation + Infrastructure Elegance

### Added

- **E2E tests now run in git worktrees.** Gemini and Codex tests no longer pollute your working tree. Each test suite gets an isolated worktree, and useful changes the AI agent makes are automatically harvested as patches you can cherry-pick. Run `git apply ~/.gstack-dev/harvests/<id>/gemini.patch` to grab improvements.
- **Harvest deduplication.** If a test keeps producing the same improvement across runs, it's detected via SHA-256 hash and skipped — no duplicate patches piling up.
- **`describeWithWorktree()` helper.** Any E2E test can now opt into worktree isolation with a one-line wrapper. Future tests that need real repo context (git history, real diff) can use this instead of tmpdirs.

### Changed

- **Gen-skill-docs is now a modular resolver pipeline.** The monolithic 1700-line generator is split into 8 focused resolver modules (browse, preamble, design, review, testing, utility, constants, codex-helpers). Adding a new placeholder resolver is now a single file instead of editing a megafunction.
- **Eval results are project-scoped.** Results now live in `~/.gstack/projects/$SLUG/evals/` instead of the global `~/.gstack-dev/evals/`. Multi-project users no longer get eval results mixed together.

### For contributors

- WorktreeManager (`lib/worktree.ts`) is a reusable platform module — future skills like `/batch` can import it directly.
- 12 new unit tests for WorktreeManager covering lifecycle, harvest, dedup, and error handling.
- `GLOBAL_TOUCHFILES` updated so worktree infrastructure changes trigger all E2E tests.

## [0.11.12.0] - 2026-03-24 — Triple-Voice Autoplan

Every `/autoplan` phase now gets two independent second opinions — one from Codex (OpenAI's frontier model) and one from a fresh Claude subagent. Three AI reviewers looking at your plan from different angles, each phase building on the last.

### Added

- **Dual voices in every autoplan phase.** CEO review, Design review, and Eng review each run both a Codex challenge and an independent Claude subagent simultaneously. You get a consensus table showing where the models agree and disagree — disagreements surface as taste decisions at the final gate.
- **Phase-cascading context.** Codex gets prior-phase findings as context (CEO concerns inform Design review, CEO+Design inform Eng). Claude subagent stays truly independent for genuine cross-model validation.
- **Structured consensus tables.** CEO phase scores 6 strategic dimensions, Design uses the litmus scorecard, Eng scores 6 architecture dimensions. CONFIRMED/DISAGREE for each.
- **Cross-phase synthesis.** Phase 4 gate highlights themes that appeared independently in multiple phases — high-confidence signals when different reviewers catch the same issue.
- **Sequential enforcement.** STOP markers between phases + pre-phase checklists prevent autoplan from accidentally parallelizing CEO/Design/Eng (each phase depends on the previous).
- **Phase-transition summaries.** Brief status at each phase boundary so you can track progress without waiting for the full pipeline.
- **Degradation matrix.** When Codex or the Claude subagent fails, autoplan gracefully degrades with clear labels (`[codex-only]`, `[subagent-only]`, `[single-reviewer mode]`).

## [0.11.11.0] - 2026-03-23 — Community Wave 3

10 community PRs merged — bug fixes, platform support, and workflow improvements.

### Added

- **Chrome multi-profile cookie import.** You can now import cookies from any Chrome profile, not just Default. Profile picker shows account email for easy identification. Batch import across all visible domains.
- **Linux Chromium cookie import.** Cookie import now works on Linux for Chrome, Chromium, Brave, and Edge. Supports both GNOME Keyring (libsecret) and the "peanuts" fallback for headless environments.
- **Chrome extensions in browse sessions.** Set `BROWSE_EXTENSIONS_DIR` to load Chrome extensions (ad blockers, accessibility tools, custom headers) into your browse testing sessions.
- **Project-scoped gstack install.** `setup --local` installs gstack into `.claude/skills/` in your current project instead of globally. Useful for per-project version pinning.
- **Distribution pipeline checks.** `/office-hours`, `/plan-eng-review`, `/ship`, and `/review` now check whether new CLI tools or libraries have a build/publish pipeline. No more shipping artifacts nobody can download.
- **Dynamic skill discovery.** Adding a new skill directory no longer requires editing a hardcoded list. `skill-check` and `gen-skill-docs` automatically discover skills from the filesystem.
- **Auto-trigger guard.** Skills now include explicit trigger criteria in their descriptions to prevent Claude Code from auto-firing them based on semantic similarity. The existing proactive suggestion system is preserved.

### Fixed

- **Browse server startup crash.** The browse server lock acquisition failed when `.gstack/` directory didn't exist, causing every invocation to think another process held the lock. Fixed by creating the state directory before lock acquisition.
- **Zsh glob errors in skill preamble.** The telemetry cleanup loop no longer throws `no matches found` in zsh when no pending files exist.
- **`--force` now actually forces upgrades.** `gstack-upgrade --force` clears the snooze file, so you can upgrade immediately after snoozing.
- **Three-dot diff in /review scope drift detection.** Scope drift analysis now correctly shows changes since branch creation, not accumulated changes on the base branch.
- **CI workflow YAML parsing.** Fixed unquoted multiline `run:` scalars that broke YAML parsing. Added actionlint CI workflow.

### Community

Thanks to @osc, @Explorer1092, @Qike-Li, @francoisaubert1, @itstimwhite, @yinanli1917-cloud for contributions in this wave.

## [0.11.10.0] - 2026-03-23 — CI Evals on Ubicloud

### Added

- **E2E evals now run in CI on every PR.** 12 parallel GitHub Actions runners on Ubicloud spin up per PR, each running one test suite. Docker image pre-bakes bun, node, Claude CLI, and deps so setup is near-instant. Results posted as a PR comment with pass/fail + cost breakdown.
- **3x faster eval runs.** All E2E tests run concurrently within files via `testConcurrentIfSelected`. Wall clock drops from ~18min to ~6min — limited by the slowest individual test, not sequential sum.
- **Docker CI image** (`Dockerfile.ci`) with pre-installed toolchain. Rebuilds automatically when Dockerfile or package.json changes, cached by content hash in GHCR.

### Fixed

- **Routing tests now work in CI.** Skills are installed at top-level `.claude/skills/` instead of nested under `.claude/skills/gstack/` — project-level skill discovery doesn't recurse into subdirectories.

### For contributors

- `EVALS_CONCURRENCY=40` in CI for maximum parallelism (local default stays at 15)
- Ubicloud runners at ~$0.006/run (10x cheaper than GitHub standard runners)
- `workflow_dispatch` trigger for manual re-runs

## [0.11.9.0] - 2026-03-23 — Codex Skill Loading Fix

### Fixed

- **Codex no longer rejects gstack skills with "invalid SKILL.md".** Existing installs had oversized description fields (>1024 chars) that Codex silently rejected. The build now errors if any Codex description exceeds 1024 chars, setup always regenerates `.agents/` to prevent stale files, and a one-time migration auto-cleans oversized descriptions on existing installs.
- **`package.json` version now stays in sync with `VERSION`.** Was 6 minor versions behind. A new CI test catches future drift.

### Added

- **Codex E2E tests now assert no skill loading errors.** The exact "Skipped loading skill(s)" error that prompted this fix is now a regression test — `stderr` is captured and checked.
- **Codex troubleshooting entry in README.** Manual fix instructions for users who hit the loading error before the auto-migration runs.

### For contributors

- `test/gen-skill-docs.test.ts` validates all `.agents/` descriptions stay within 1024 chars
- `gstack-update-check` includes a one-time migration that deletes oversized Codex SKILL.md files
- P1 TODO added: Codex→Claude reverse buddy check skill

## [0.11.8.0] - 2026-03-23 — zsh Compatibility Fix

### Fixed

- **gstack skills now work in zsh without errors.** Every skill preamble used a `.pending-*` glob pattern that triggered zsh's "no matches found" error on every invocation (the common case where no pending telemetry files exist). Replaced shell glob with `find` to avoid zsh's NOMATCH behavior entirely. Thanks to @hnshah for the initial report and fix in PR #332. Fixes #313.

### Added

- **Regression test for zsh glob safety.** New test verifies all generated SKILL.md files use `find` instead of bare shell globs for `.pending-*` pattern matching.

## [0.11.7.0] - 2026-03-23 — /review → /ship Handoff Fix

### Fixed

- **`/review` now satisfies the ship readiness gate.** Previously, running `/review` before `/ship` always showed "NOT CLEARED" because `/review` didn't log its result and `/ship` only looked for `/plan-eng-review`. Now `/review` persists its outcome to the review log, and all dashboards recognize both `/review` (diff-scoped) and `/plan-eng-review` (plan-stage) as valid Eng Review sources.
- **Ship abort prompt now mentions both review options.** When Eng Review is missing, `/ship` suggests "run `/review` or `/plan-eng-review`" instead of only mentioning `/plan-eng-review`.

### For contributors

- Based on PR #338 by @malikrohail. DRY improvement per eng review: updated the shared `REVIEW_DASHBOARD` resolver instead of creating a duplicate ship-only resolver.
- 4 new validation tests covering review-log persistence, dashboard propagation, and abort text.

## [0.11.6.0] - 2026-03-23 — Infrastructure-First Security Audit

### Added

- **`/cso` v2 — start where the breaches actually happen.** The security audit now begins with your infrastructure attack surface (leaked secrets in git history, dependency CVEs, CI/CD pipeline misconfigurations, unverified webhooks, Dockerfile security) before touching application code. 15 phases covering secrets archaeology, supply chain, CI/CD, LLM/AI security, skill supply chain, OWASP Top 10, STRIDE, and active verification.
- **Two audit modes.** `--daily` runs a zero-noise scan with an 8/10 confidence gate (only reports findings it's highly confident about). `--comprehensive` does a deep monthly scan with a 2/10 bar (surfaces everything worth investigating).
- **Active verification.** Every finding gets independently verified by a subagent before reporting — no more grep-and-guess. Variant analysis: when one vulnerability is confirmed, the entire codebase is searched for the same pattern.
- **Trend tracking.** Findings are fingerprinted and tracked across audit runs. You can see what's new, what's fixed, and what's been ignored.
- **Diff-scoped auditing.** `--diff` mode scopes the audit to changes on your branch vs the base branch — perfect for pre-merge security checks.
- **3 E2E tests** with planted vulnerabilities (hardcoded API keys, tracked `.env` files, unsigned webhooks, unpinned GitHub Actions, rootless Dockerfiles). All verified passing.

### Changed

- **Stack detection before scanning.** v1 ran Ruby/Java/PHP/C# patterns on every project without checking the stack. v2 detects your framework first and prioritizes relevant checks.
- **Proper tool usage.** v1 used raw `grep` in Bash; v2 uses Claude Code's native `Grep` tool for reliable results without truncation.

## [0.11.5.2] - 2026-03-22 — Outside Voice

### Added

- **Plan reviews now offer an independent second opinion.** After all review sections complete in `/plan-ceo-review` or `/plan-eng-review`, you can get a "brutally honest outside voice" from a different AI model (Codex CLI, or a fresh Claude subagent if Codex isn't installed). It reads your plan, finds what the review missed — logical gaps, unstated assumptions, feasibility risks — and presents findings verbatim. Optional, recommended, never blocks shipping.
- **Cross-model tension detection.** When the outside voice disagrees with the review findings, the disagreements are surfaced automatically and offered as TODOs so nothing gets lost.
- **Outside Voice in the Review Readiness Dashboard.** `/ship` now shows whether an outside voice ran on the plan, alongside the existing CEO/Eng/Design/Adversarial review rows.

### Changed

- **`/plan-eng-review` Codex integration upgraded.** The old hardcoded Step 0.5 is replaced with a richer resolver that adds Claude subagent fallback, review log persistence, dashboard visibility, and higher reasoning effort (`xhigh`).

## [0.11.5.1] - 2026-03-23 — Inline Office Hours

### Changed

- **No more "open another window" for /office-hours.** When `/plan-ceo-review` or `/plan-eng-review` offer to run `/office-hours` first, it now runs inline in the same conversation. The review picks up right where it left off after the design doc is ready. Same for mid-session detection when you're still figuring out what to build.
- **Handoff note infrastructure removed.** The handoff notes that bridged the old "go to another window" flow are no longer written. Existing notes from prior sessions are still read for backward compatibility.

## [0.11.5.0] - 2026-03-23 — Bash Compatibility Fix

### Fixed

- **`gstack-review-read` and `gstack-review-log` no longer crash under bash.** These scripts used `source <(gstack-slug)` which silently fails to set variables under bash with `set -euo pipefail`, causing `SLUG: unbound variable` errors. Replaced with `eval "$(gstack-slug)"` which works correctly in both bash and zsh.
- **All SKILL.md templates updated.** Every template that instructed agents to run `source <(gstack-slug)` now uses `eval "$(gstack-slug)"` for cross-shell compatibility. Regenerated all SKILL.md files from templates.
- **Regression tests added.** New tests verify `eval "$(gstack-slug)"` works under bash strict mode, and guard against `source <(.*gstack-slug` patterns reappearing in templates or bin scripts.

## [0.11.4.0] - 2026-03-22 — Codex in Office Hours

### Added

- **Your brainstorming now gets a second opinion.** After premise challenge in `/office-hours`, you can opt in to a Codex cold read — a completely independent AI that hasn't seen the conversation reviews your problem, answers, and premises. It steelmans your idea, identifies the most revealing thing you said, challenges one premise, and proposes a 48-hour prototype. Two different AI models seeing different things catches blind spots neither would find alone.
- **Cross-Model Perspective in design docs.** When you use the second opinion, the design doc automatically includes a `## Cross-Model Perspective` section capturing what Codex said — so the independent view is preserved for downstream reviews.
- **New founder signal: defended premise with reasoning.** When Codex challenges one of your premises and you keep it with articulated reasoning (not just dismissal), that's tracked as a positive signal of conviction.

## [0.11.3.0] - 2026-03-23 — Design Outside Voices

### Added

- **Every design review now gets a second opinion.** `/plan-design-review`, `/design-review`, and `/design-consultation` dispatch both Codex (OpenAI) and a fresh Claude subagent in parallel to independently evaluate your design — then synthesize findings with a litmus scorecard showing where they agree and disagree. Cross-model agreement = high confidence; disagreement = investigate.
- **OpenAI's design hard rules baked in.** 7 hard rejection criteria, 7 litmus checks, and a landing-page vs app-UI classifier from OpenAI's "Designing Delightful Frontends" framework — merged with gstack's existing 10-item AI slop blacklist. Your design gets evaluated against the same rules OpenAI recommends for their own models.
- **Codex design voice in every PR.** The lightweight design review that runs in `/ship` and `/review` now includes a Codex design check when frontend files change — automatic, no opt-in needed.
- **Outside voices in /office-hours brainstorming.** After wireframe sketches, you can now get Codex + Claude subagent design perspectives on your approaches before committing to a direction.
- **AI slop blacklist extracted as shared constant.** The 10 anti-patterns (purple gradients, 3-column icon grids, centered everything, etc.) are now defined once and shared across all design skills. Easier to maintain, impossible to drift.

## [0.11.2.0] - 2026-03-22 — Codex Just Works

### Fixed

- **Codex no longer shows "exceeds maximum length of 1024 characters" on startup.** Skill descriptions compressed from ~1,200 words to ~280 words — well under the limit. Every skill now has a test enforcing the cap.
- **No more duplicate skill discovery.** Codex used to find both source SKILL.md files and generated Codex skills, showing every skill twice. Setup now creates a minimal runtime root at `~/.codex/skills/gstack` with only the assets Codex needs — no source files exposed.
- **Old direct installs auto-migrate.** If you previously cloned gstack into `~/.codex/skills/gstack`, setup detects this and moves it to `~/.gstack/repos/gstack` so skills aren't discovered from the source checkout.
- **Sidecar directory no longer linked as a skill.** The `.agents/skills/gstack` runtime asset directory was incorrectly symlinked alongside real skills — now skipped.

### Added

- **Repo-local Codex installs.** Clone gstack into `.agents/skills/gstack` inside any repo and run `./setup --host codex` — skills install next to the checkout, no global `~/.codex/` needed. Generated preambles auto-detect whether to use repo-local or global paths at runtime.
- **Kiro CLI support.** `./setup --host kiro` installs skills for the Kiro agent platform, rewriting paths and symlinking runtime assets. Auto-detected by `--host auto` if `kiro-cli` is installed.
- **`.agents/` is now gitignored.** Generated Codex skill files are no longer committed — they're created at setup time from templates. Removes 14,000+ lines of generated output from the repo.

### Changed

- **`GSTACK_DIR` renamed to `SOURCE_GSTACK_DIR` / `INSTALL_GSTACK_DIR`** throughout the setup script for clarity about which path points to the source repo vs the install location.
- **CI validates Codex generation succeeds** instead of checking committed file freshness (since `.agents/` is no longer committed).

## [0.11.1.1] - 2026-03-22 — Plan Files Always Show Review Status

### Added

- **Every plan file now shows review status.** When you exit plan mode, the plan file automatically gets a `GSTACK REVIEW REPORT` section — even if you haven't run any formal reviews yet. Previously, this section only appeared after running `/plan-eng-review`, `/plan-ceo-review`, `/plan-design-review`, or `/codex review`. Now you always know where you stand: which reviews have run, which haven't, and what to do next.

## [0.11.1.0] - 2026-03-22 — Global Retro: Cross-Project AI Coding Retrospective

### Added

- **`/retro global` — see everything you shipped across every project in one report.** Scans your Claude Code, Codex CLI, and Gemini CLI sessions, traces each back to its git repo, deduplicates by remote, then runs a full retro across all of them. Global shipping streak, context-switching metrics, per-project breakdowns with personal contributions, and cross-tool usage patterns. Run `/retro global 14d` for a two-week view.
- **Per-project personal contributions in global retro.** Each project in the global retro now shows YOUR commits, LOC, key work, commit type mix, and biggest ship — separate from team totals. Solo projects say "Solo project — all commits are yours." Team projects you didn't touch show session count only.
- **`gstack-global-discover` — the engine behind global retro.** Standalone discovery script that finds all AI coding sessions on your machine, resolves working directories to git repos, normalizes SSH/HTTPS remotes for dedup, and outputs structured JSON. Compiled binary ships with gstack — no `bun` runtime needed.

### Fixed

- **Discovery script reads only the first few KB of session files** instead of loading entire multi-MB JSONL transcripts into memory. Prevents OOM on machines with extensive coding history.
- **Claude Code session counts are now accurate.** Previously counted all JSONL files in a project directory; now only counts files modified within the time window.
- **Week windows (`1w`, `2w`) are now midnight-aligned** like day windows, so `/retro global 1w` and `/retro global 7d` produce consistent results.

## [0.11.0.0] - 2026-03-22 — /cso: Zero-Noise Security Audits

### Added

- **`/cso` — your Chief Security Officer.** Full codebase security audit: OWASP Top 10, STRIDE threat modeling, attack surface mapping, data classification, and dependency scanning. Each finding includes severity, confidence score, a concrete exploit scenario, and remediation options. Not a linter — a threat model.
- **Zero-noise false positive filtering.** 17 hard exclusions and 9 precedents adapted from Anthropic's security review methodology. DOS isn't a finding. Test files aren't attack surface. React is XSS-safe by default. Every finding must score 8/10+ confidence to make the report. The result: 3 real findings, not 3 real + 12 theoretical.
- **Independent finding verification.** Each candidate finding is verified by a fresh sub-agent that only sees the finding and the false positive rules — no anchoring bias from the initial scan. Findings that fail independent verification are silently dropped.
- **`browse storage` now redacts secrets automatically.** Tokens, JWTs, API keys, GitHub PATs, and Bearer tokens are detected by both key name and value prefix. You see `[REDACTED — 42 chars]` instead of the secret.
- **Azure metadata endpoint blocked.** SSRF protection for `browse goto` now covers all three major cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure).

### Fixed

- **`gstack-slug` hardened against shell injection.** Output sanitized to alphanumeric, dot, dash, and underscore only. All remaining `eval $(gstack-slug)` callers migrated to `source <(...)`.
- **DNS rebinding protection.** `browse goto` now resolves hostnames to IPs and checks against the metadata blocklist — prevents attacks where a domain initially resolves to a safe IP, then switches to a cloud metadata endpoint.
- **Concurrent server start race fixed.** An exclusive lockfile prevents two CLI invocations from both killing the old server and starting new ones simultaneously, which could leave orphaned Chromium processes.
- **Smarter storage redaction.** Key matching now uses underscore-aware boundaries (won't false-positive on `keyboardShortcuts` or `monkeyPatch`). Value detection expanded to cover AWS, Stripe, Anthropic, Google, Sendgrid, and Supabase key prefixes.
- **CI workflow YAML lint error fixed.**

### For contributors

- **Community PR triage process documented** in CONTRIBUTING.md.
- **Storage redaction test coverage.** Four new tests for key-based and value-based detection.

## [0.10.2.0] - 2026-03-22 — Autoplan Depth Fix

### Fixed

- **`/autoplan` now produces full-depth reviews instead of compressing everything to one-liners.** When autoplan said "auto-decide," it meant "decide FOR the user using principles" — but the agent interpreted it as "skip the analysis entirely." Now autoplan explicitly defines the contract: auto-decide replaces your judgment, not the analysis. Every review section still gets read, diagrammed, and evaluated. You get the same depth as running each review manually.
- **Execution checklists for CEO and Eng phases.** Each phase now enumerates exactly what must be produced — premise challenges, architecture diagrams, test coverage maps, failure registries, artifacts on disk. No more "follow that file at full depth" without saying what "full depth" means.
- **Pre-gate verification catches skipped outputs.** Before presenting the final approval gate, autoplan now checks a concrete checklist of required outputs. Missing items get produced before the gate opens (max 2 retries, then warns).
- **Test review can never be skipped.** The Eng review's test diagram section — the highest-value output — is explicitly marked NEVER SKIP OR COMPRESS with instructions to read actual diffs, map every codepath to coverage, and write the test plan artifact.

## [0.10.1.0] - 2026-03-22 — Test Coverage Catalog

### Added

- **Test coverage audit now works everywhere — plan, ship, and review.** The codepath tracing methodology (ASCII diagrams, quality scoring, gap detection) is shared across `/plan-eng-review`, `/ship`, and `/review` via a single `{{TEST_COVERAGE_AUDIT}}` resolver. Plan mode adds missing tests to your plan before you write code. Ship mode auto-generates tests for gaps. Review mode finds untested paths during pre-landing review. One methodology, three contexts, zero copy-paste.
- **`/review` Step 4.75 — test coverage diagram.** Before landing code, `/review` now traces every changed codepath and produces an ASCII coverage map showing what's tested (★★★/★★/★) and what's not (GAP). Gaps become INFORMATIONAL findings that follow the Fix-First flow — you can generate the missing tests right there.
- **E2E test recommendations built in.** The coverage audit knows when to recommend E2E tests (common user flows, tricky integrations where unit tests can't cover it) vs unit tests, and flags LLM prompt changes that need eval coverage. No more guessing whether something needs an integration test.
- **Regression detection iron rule.** When a code change modifies existing behavior, gstack always writes a regression test — no asking, no skipping. If you changed it, you test it.
- **`/ship` failure triage.** When tests fail during ship, the coverage audit classifies each failure and recommends next steps instead of just dumping the error output.
- **Test framework auto-detection.** Reads your CLAUDE.md for test commands first, then auto-detects from project files (package.json, Gemfile, pyproject.toml, etc.). Works with any framework.

### Fixed

- **gstack no longer crashes in repos without an `origin` remote.** The `gstack-repo-mode` helper now gracefully handles missing remotes, bare repos, and empty git output — defaulting to `unknown` mode instead of crashing the preamble.
- **`REPO_MODE` defaults correctly when the helper emits nothing.** Previously an empty response from `gstack-repo-mode` left `REPO_MODE` unset, causing downstream template errors.

## [0.10.0.0] - 2026-03-22 — Autoplan

### Added

- **`/autoplan` — one command, fully reviewed plan.** Hand it a rough plan and it runs the full CEO → design → eng review pipeline automatically. Reads the actual review skill files from disk (same depth, same rigor as running each review manually) and makes intermediate decisions using 6 encoded principles: completeness, boil lakes, pragmatic, DRY, explicit over clever, bias toward action. Taste decisions (close approaches, borderline scope, codex disagreements) surface at a final approval gate. You approve, override, interrogate, or revise. Saves a restore point so you can re-run from scratch. Writes review logs compatible with `/ship`'s dashboard.

## [0.9.8.0] - 2026-03-21 — Deploy Pipeline + E2E Performance

### Added

- **`/land-and-deploy` — merge, deploy, and verify in one command.** Takes over where `/ship` left off. Merges the PR, waits for CI and deploy workflows, then runs canary verification on your production URL. Auto-detects your deploy platform (Fly.io, Render, Vercel, Netlify, Heroku, GitHub Actions). Offers revert at every failure point. One command from "PR approved" to "verified in production."
- **`/canary` — post-deploy monitoring loop.** Watches your live app for console errors, performance regressions, and page failures using the browse daemon. Takes periodic screenshots, compares against pre-deploy baselines, and alerts on anomalies. Run `/canary https://myapp.com --duration 10m` after any deploy.
- **`/benchmark` — performance regression detection.** Establishes baselines for page load times, Core Web Vitals, and resource sizes. Compares before/after on every PR. Tracks performance trends over time. Catches the bundle size regressions that code review misses.
- **`/setup-deploy` — one-time deploy configuration.** Detects your deploy platform, production URL, health check endpoints, and deploy status commands. Writes the config to CLAUDE.md so all future `/land-and-deploy` runs are fully automatic.
- **`/review` now includes Performance & Bundle Impact analysis.** The informational review pass checks for heavy dependencies, missing lazy loading, synchronous script tags, and bundle size regressions. Catches moment.js-instead-of-date-fns before it ships.

### Changed

- **E2E tests now run 3-5x faster.** Structure tests default to Sonnet (5x faster, 5x cheaper). Quality tests (planted-bug detection, design quality, strategic review) stay on Opus. Full suite dropped from 50-80 minutes to ~15-25 minutes.
- **`--retry 2` on all E2E tests.** Flaky tests get a second chance without masking real failures.
- **`test:e2e:fast` tier.** Excludes the 8 slowest Opus quality tests for quick feedback (~5-7 minutes). Run `bun run test:e2e:fast` for rapid iteration.
- **E2E timing telemetry.** Every test now records `first_response_ms`, `max_inter_turn_ms`, and `model` used. Wall-clock timing shows whether parallelism is actually working.

### Fixed

- **`plan-design-review-plan-mode` no longer races.** Each test gets its own isolated tmpdir — no more concurrent tests polluting each other's working directory.
- **`ship-local-workflow` no longer wastes 6 of 15 turns.** Ship workflow steps are inlined in the test prompt instead of having the agent read the 700+ line SKILL.md at runtime.
- **`design-consultation-core` no longer fails on synonym sections.** "Colors" matches "Color", "Type System" matches "Typography" — fuzzy synonym-based matching with all 7 sections still required.

## [0.9.7.0] - 2026-03-21 — Plan File Review Report

### Added

- **Every plan file now shows which reviews have run.** After any review skill finishes (`/plan-ceo-review`, `/plan-eng-review`, `/plan-design-review`, `/codex review`), a markdown table is appended to the plan file itself — showing each review's trigger command, purpose, run count, status, and findings summary. Anyone reading the plan can see review status at a glance without checking conversation history.
- **Review logs now capture richer data.** CEO reviews log scope proposal counts (proposed/accepted/deferred), eng reviews log total issues found, design reviews log before→after scores, and codex reviews log how many findings were fixed. The plan file report uses these fields directly — no more guessing from partial metadata.

## [0.9.6.0] - 2026-03-21 — Auto-Scaled Adversarial Review

### Changed

- **Review thoroughness now scales automatically with diff size.** Small diffs (<50 lines) skip adversarial review entirely — no wasted time on typo fixes. Medium diffs (50–199 lines) get a cross-model adversarial challenge from Codex (or a Claude adversarial subagent if Codex isn't installed). Large diffs (200+ lines) get all four passes: Claude structured, Codex structured review with pass/fail gate, Claude adversarial subagent, and Codex adversarial challenge. No configuration needed — it just works.
- **Claude now has an adversarial mode.** A fresh Claude subagent with no checklist bias reviews your code like an attacker — finding edge cases, race conditions, security holes, and silent data corruption that the structured review might miss. Findings are classified as FIXABLE (auto-fixed) or INVESTIGATE (your call).
- **Review dashboard shows "Adversarial" instead of "Codex Review."** The dashboard row reflects the new multi-model reality — it tracks whichever adversarial passes actually ran, not just Codex.

## [0.9.5.0] - 2026-03-21 — Builder Ethos

### Added

- **ETHOS.md — gstack's builder philosophy in one document.** Four principles: The Golden Age (AI compression ratios), Boil the Lake (completeness is cheap), Search Before Building (three layers of knowledge), and Build for Yourself. This is the philosophical source of truth that every workflow skill references.
- **Every workflow skill now searches before recommending.** Before suggesting infrastructure patterns, concurrency approaches, or framework-specific solutions, gstack checks if the runtime has a built-in and whether the pattern is current best practice. Three layers of knowledge — tried-and-true (Layer 1), new-and-popular (Layer 2), and first-principles (Layer 3) — with the most valuable insights prized above all.
- **Eureka moments.** When first-principles reasoning reveals that conventional wisdom is wrong, gstack names it, celebrates it, and logs it. Your weekly `/retro` now surfaces these insights so you can see where your projects zigged while others zagged.
- **`/office-hours` adds Landscape Awareness phase.** After understanding your problem through questioning but before challenging premises, gstack searches for what the world thinks — then runs a three-layer synthesis to find where conventional wisdom might be wrong for your specific case.
- **`/plan-eng-review` adds search check.** Step 0 now verifies architectural patterns against current best practices and flags custom solutions where built-ins exist.
- **`/investigate` searches on hypothesis failure.** When your first debugging hypothesis is wrong, gstack searches for the exact error message and known framework issues before guessing again.
- **`/design-consultation` three-layer synthesis.** Competitive research now uses the structured Layer 1/2/3 framework to find where your product should deliberately break from category norms.
- **CEO review saves context when handing off to `/office-hours`.** When `/plan-ceo-review` suggests running `/office-hours` first, it now saves a handoff note with your system audit findings and any discussion so far. When you come back and re-invoke `/plan-ceo-review`, it picks up that context automatically — no more starting from scratch.

## [0.9.4.1] - 2026-03-20

### Changed

- **`/retro` no longer nags about PR size.** The retro still reports PR size distribution (Small/Medium/Large/XL) as neutral data, but no longer flags XL PRs as problems or recommends splitting them. AI reviews don't fatigue — the unit of work is the feature, not the diff.

## [0.9.4.0] - 2026-03-20 — Codex Reviews On By Default

### Changed

- **Codex code reviews now run automatically in `/ship` and `/review`.** No more "want a second opinion?" prompt every time — Codex reviews both your code (with a pass/fail gate) and runs an adversarial challenge by default. First-time users get a one-time opt-in prompt; after that, it's hands-free. Configure with `gstack-config set codex_reviews enabled|disabled`.
- **All Codex operations use maximum reasoning power.** Review, adversarial, and consult modes all use `xhigh` reasoning effort — when an AI is reviewing your code, you want it thinking as hard as possible.
- **Codex review errors can't corrupt the dashboard.** Auth failures, timeouts, and empty responses are now detected before logging results, so the Review Readiness Dashboard never shows a false "passed" entry. Adversarial stderr is captured separately.
- **Codex review log includes commit hash.** Staleness detection now works correctly for Codex reviews, matching the same commit-tracking behavior as eng/CEO/design reviews.

### Fixed

- **Codex-for-Codex recursion prevented.** When gstack runs inside Codex CLI (`.agents/skills/`), the Codex review step is completely stripped — no accidental infinite loops.

## [0.9.3.0] - 2026-03-20 — Windows Support

### Fixed

- **gstack now works on Windows 11.** Setup no longer hangs when verifying Playwright, and the browse server automatically falls back to Node.js to work around a Bun pipe-handling bug on Windows ([bun#4253](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/4253)). Just make sure Node.js is installed alongside Bun. macOS and Linux are completely unaffected.
- **Path handling works on Windows.** All hardcoded `/tmp` paths and Unix-style path separators now use platform-aware equivalents via a new `platform.ts` module. Path traversal protection works correctly with Windows backslash separators.

### Added

- **Bun API polyfill for Node.js.** When the browse server runs under Node.js on Windows, a compatibility layer provides `Bun.serve()`, `Bun.spawn()`, `Bun.spawnSync()`, and `Bun.sleep()` equivalents. Fully tested.
- **Node server build script.** `browse/scripts/build-node-server.sh` transpiles the server for Node.js, stubs `bun:sqlite`, and injects the polyfill — all automated during `bun run build`.

## [0.9.2.0] - 2026-03-20 — Gemini CLI E2E Tests

### Added

- **Gemini CLI is now tested end-to-end.** Two E2E tests verify that gstack skills work when invoked by Google's Gemini CLI (`gemini -p`). The `gemini-discover-skill` test confirms skill discovery from `.agents/skills/`, and `gemini-review-findings` runs a full code review via gstack-review. Both parse Gemini's stream-json NDJSON output and track token usage.
- **Gemini JSONL parser with 10 unit tests.** `parseGeminiJSONL` handles all Gemini event types (init, message, tool_use, tool_result, result) with defensive parsing for malformed input. The parser is a pure function, independently testable without spawning the CLI.
- **`bun run test:gemini`** and **`bun run test:gemini:all`** scripts for running Gemini E2E tests independently. Gemini tests are also included in `test:evals` and `test:e2e` aggregate scripts.

## [0.9.1.0] - 2026-03-20 — Adversarial Spec Review + Skill Chaining

### Added

- **Your design docs now get stress-tested before you see them.** When you run `/office-hours`, an independent AI reviewer checks your design doc for completeness, consistency, clarity, scope creep, and feasibility — up to 3 rounds. You get a quality score (1-10) and a summary of what was caught and fixed. The doc you approve has already survived adversarial review.
- **Visual wireframes during brainstorming.** For UI ideas, `/office-hours` now generates a rough HTML wireframe using your project's design system (from DESIGN.md) and screenshots it. You see what you're designing while you're still thinking, not after you've coded it.
- **Skills help each other now.** `/plan-ceo-review` and `/plan-eng-review` detect when you'd benefit from running `/office-hours` first and offer it — one-tap to switch, one-tap to decline. If you seem lost during a CEO review, it'll gently suggest brainstorming first.
- **Spec review metrics.** Every adversarial review logs iterations, issues found/fixed, and quality score to `~/.gstack/analytics/spec-review.jsonl`. Over time, you can see if your design docs are getting better.

## [0.9.0.1] - 2026-03-19

### Changed

- **Telemetry opt-in now defaults to community mode.** First-time prompt asks "Help gstack get better!" (community mode with stable device ID for trend tracking). If you decline, you get a second chance with anonymous mode (no unique ID, just a counter). Respects your choice either way.

### Fixed

- **Review logs and telemetry now persist during plan mode.** When you ran `/plan-ceo-review`, `/plan-eng-review`, or `/plan-design-review` in plan mode, the review result wasn't saved to disk — so the dashboard showed stale or missing entries even though you just completed a review. Same issue affected telemetry logging at the end of every skill. Both now work reliably in plan mode.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-03-19 — Works on Codex, Gemini CLI, and Cursor

**gstack now works on any AI agent that supports the open SKILL.md standard.** Install once, use from Claude Code, OpenAI Codex CLI, Google Gemini CLI, or Cursor. All 21 skills are available in `.agents/skills/` -- just run `./setup --host codex` or `./setup --host auto` and your agent discovers them automatically.

- **One install, four agents.** Claude Code reads from `.claude/skills/`, everything else reads from `.agents/skills/`. Same skills, same prompts, adapted for each host. Hook-based safety skills (careful, freeze, guard) get inline safety advisory prose instead of hooks -- they work everywhere.
- **Auto-detection.** `./setup --host auto` detects which agents you have installed and sets up both. Already have Claude Code? It still works exactly the same.
- **Codex-adapted output.** Frontmatter is stripped to just name + description (Codex doesn't need allowed-tools or hooks). Paths are rewritten from `~/.claude/` to `~/.codex/`. The `/codex` skill itself is excluded from Codex output -- it's a Claude wrapper around `codex exec`, which would be self-referential.
- **CI checks both hosts.** The freshness check now validates Claude and Codex output independently. Stale Codex docs break the build just like stale Claude docs.

## [0.8.6] - 2026-03-19

### Added

- **You can now see how you use gstack.** Run `gstack-analytics` to see a personal usage dashboard — which skills you use most, how long they take, your success rate. All data stays local on your machine.
- **Opt-in community telemetry.** On first run, gstack asks if you want to share anonymous usage data (skill names, duration, crash info — never code or file paths). Choose "yes" and you're part of the community pulse. Change anytime with `gstack-config set telemetry off`.
- **Community health dashboard.** Run `gstack-community-dashboard` to see what the gstack community is building — most popular skills, crash clusters, version distribution. All powered by Supabase.
- **Install base tracking via update check.** When telemetry is enabled, gstack fires a parallel ping to Supabase during update checks — giving us an install-base count without adding any latency. Respects your telemetry setting (default off). GitHub remains the primary version source.
- **Crash clustering.** Errors are automatically grouped by type and version in the Supabase backend, so the most impactful bugs surface first.
- **Upgrade funnel tracking.** We can now see how many people see upgrade prompts vs actually upgrade — helps us ship better releases.
- **/retro now shows your gstack usage.** Weekly retrospectives include skill usage stats (which skills you used, how often, success rate) alongside your commit history.
- **Session-specific pending markers.** If a skill crashes mid-run, the next invocation correctly finalizes only that session — no more race conditions between concurrent gstack sessions.

## [0.8.5] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed

- **`/retro` now counts full calendar days.** Running a retro late at night no longer silently misses commits from earlier in the day. Git treats bare dates like `--since="2026-03-11"` as "11pm on March 11" if you run it at 11pm — now we pass `--since="2026-03-11T00:00:00"` so it always starts from midnight. Compare mode windows get the same fix.
- **Review log no longer breaks on branch names with `/`.** Branch names like `garrytan/design-system` caused review log writes to fail because Claude Code runs multi-line bash blocks as separate shell invocations, losing variables between commands. New `gstack-review-log` and `gstack-review-read` atomic helpers encapsulate the entire operation in a single command.
- **All skill templates are now platform-agnostic.** Removed Rails-specific patterns (`bin/test-lane`, `RAILS_ENV`, `.includes()`, `rescue StandardError`, etc.) from `/ship`, `/review`, `/plan-ceo-review`, and `/plan-eng-review`. The review checklist now shows examples for Rails, Node, Python, and Django side-by-side.
- **`/ship` reads CLAUDE.md to discover test commands** instead of hardcoding `bin/test-lane` and `npm run test`. If no test commands are found, it asks the user and persists the answer to CLAUDE.md.

### Added

- **Platform-agnostic design principle** codified in CLAUDE.md — skills must read project config, never hardcode framework commands.
- **`## Testing` section** in CLAUDE.md for `/ship` test command discovery.

## [0.8.4] - 2026-03-19

### Added

- **`/ship` now automatically syncs your docs.** After creating the PR, `/ship` runs `/document-release` as Step 8.5 — README, ARCHITECTURE, CONTRIBUTING, and CLAUDE.md all stay current without an extra command. No more stale docs after shipping.
- **Six new skills in the docs.** README, docs/skills.md, and BROWSER.md now cover `/codex` (multi-AI second opinion), `/careful` (destructive command warnings), `/freeze` (directory-scoped edit lock), `/guard` (full safety mode), `/unfreeze`, and `/gstack-upgrade`. The sprint skill table keeps its 15 specialists; a new "Power tools" section covers the rest.
- **Browse handoff documented everywhere.** BROWSER.md command table, docs/skills.md deep-dive, and README "What's new" all explain `$B handoff` and `$B resume` for CAPTCHA/MFA/auth walls.
- **Proactive suggestions know about all skills.** Root SKILL.md.tmpl now suggests `/codex`, `/careful`, `/freeze`, `/guard`, `/unfreeze`, and `/gstack-upgrade` at the right workflow stages.

## [0.8.3] - 2026-03-19

### Added

- **Plan reviews now guide you to the next step.** After running `/plan-ceo-review`, `/plan-eng-review`, or `/plan-design-review`, you get a recommendation for what to run next — eng review is always suggested as the required shipping gate, design review is suggested when UI changes are detected, and CEO review is softly mentioned for big product changes. No more remembering the workflow yourself.
- **Reviews know when they're stale.** Each review now records the commit it was run at. The dashboard compares that against your current HEAD and tells you exactly how many commits have elapsed — "eng review may be stale — 13 commits since review" instead of guessing.
- **`skip_eng_review` respected everywhere.** If you've opted out of eng review globally, the chaining recommendations won't nag you about it.
- **Design review lite now tracks commits too.** The lightweight design check that runs inside `/review` and `/ship` gets the same staleness tracking as full reviews.

### Fixed

- **Browse no longer navigates to dangerous URLs.** `goto`, `diff`, and `newtab` now block `file://`, `javascript:`, `data:` schemes and cloud metadata endpoints (`169.254.169.254`, `metadata.google.internal`). Localhost and private IPs are still allowed for local QA testing. (Closes #17)
- **Setup script tells you what's missing.** Running `./setup` without `bun` installed now shows a clear error with install instructions instead of a cryptic "command not found." (Closes #147)
- **`/debug` renamed to `/investigate`.** Claude Code has a built-in `/debug` command that shadowed the gstack skill. The systematic root-cause debugging workflow now lives at `/investigate`. (Closes #190)
- **Shell injection surface reduced.** gstack-slug output is now sanitized to `[a-zA-Z0-9._-]` only, making both `eval` and `source` callers safe. (Closes #133)
- **25 new security tests.** URL validation (16 tests) and path traversal validation (14 tests) now have dedicated unit test suites covering scheme blocking, metadata IP blocking, directory escapes, and prefix collision edge cases.

## [0.8.2] - 2026-03-19

### Added

- **Hand off to a real Chrome when the headless browser gets stuck.** Hit a CAPTCHA, auth wall, or MFA prompt? Run `$B handoff "reason"` and a visible Chrome opens at the exact same page with all your cookies and tabs intact. Solve the problem, tell Claude you're done, and `$B resume` picks up right where you left off with a fresh snapshot.
- **Auto-handoff hint after 3 consecutive failures.** If the browse tool fails 3 times in a row, it suggests using `handoff` — so you don't waste time watching the AI retry a CAPTCHA.
- **15 new tests for the handoff feature.** Unit tests for state save/restore, failure tracking, edge cases, plus integration tests for the full headless-to-headed flow with cookie and tab preservation.

### Changed

- `recreateContext()` refactored to use shared `saveState()`/`restoreState()` helpers — same behavior, less code, ready for future state persistence features.
- `browser.close()` now has a 5-second timeout to prevent hangs when closing headed browsers on macOS.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed

- **`/qa` no longer refuses to use the browser on backend-only changes.** Previously, if your branch only changed prompt templates, config files, or service logic, `/qa` would analyze the diff, conclude "no UI to test," and suggest running evals instead. Now it always opens the browser -- falling back to a Quick mode smoke test (homepage + top 5 navigation targets) when no specific pages are identified from the diff.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-03-19 — Multi-AI Second Opinion

**`/codex` — get an independent second opinion from a completely different AI.**

Three modes. `/codex review` runs OpenAI's Codex CLI against your diff and gives a pass/fail gate — if Codex finds critical issues (`[P1]`), it fails. `/codex challenge` goes adversarial: it tries to find ways your code will fail in production, thinking like an attacker and a chaos engineer. `/codex <anything>` opens a conversation with Codex about your codebase, with session continuity so follow-ups remember context.

When both `/review` (Claude) and `/codex review` have run, you get a cross-model analysis showing which findings overlap and which are unique to each AI — building intuition for when to trust which system.

**Integrated everywhere.** After `/review` finishes, it offers a Codex second opinion. During `/ship`, you can run Codex review as an optional gate before pushing. In `/plan-eng-review`, Codex can independently critique your plan before the engineering review begins. All Codex results show up in the Review Readiness Dashboard.

**Also in this release:** Proactive skill suggestions — gstack now notices what stage of development you're in and suggests the right skill. Don't like it? Say "stop suggesting" and it remembers across sessions.

## [0.7.4] - 2026-03-18

### Changed

- **`/qa` and `/design-review` now ask what to do with uncommitted changes** instead of refusing to start. When your working tree is dirty, you get an interactive prompt with three options: commit your changes, stash them, or abort. No more cryptic "ERROR: Working tree is dirty" followed by a wall of text.

## [0.7.3] - 2026-03-18

### Added

- **Safety guardrails you can turn on with one command.** Say "be careful" or "safety mode" and `/careful` will warn you before any destructive command — `rm -rf`, `DROP TABLE`, force-push, `kubectl delete`, and more. You can override every warning. Common build artifact cleanups (`rm -rf node_modules`, `dist`, `.next`) are whitelisted.
- **Lock edits to one folder with `/freeze`.** Debugging something and don't want Claude to "fix" unrelated code? `/freeze` blocks all file edits outside a directory you choose. Hard block, not just a warning. Run `/unfreeze` to remove the restriction without ending your session.
- **`/guard` activates both at once.** One command for maximum safety when touching prod or live systems — destructive command warnings plus directory-scoped edit restrictions.
- **`/debug` now auto-freezes edits to the module being debugged.** After forming a root cause hypothesis, `/debug` locks edits to the narrowest affected directory. No more accidental "fixes" to unrelated code during debugging.
- **You can now see which skills you use and how often.** Every skill invocation is logged locally to `~/.gstack/analytics/skill-usage.jsonl`. Run `bun run analytics` to see your top skills, per-repo breakdown, and how often safety hooks actually catch something. Data stays on your machine.
- **Weekly retros now include skill usage.** `/retro` shows which skills you used during the retro window alongside your usual commit analysis and metrics.

## [0.7.2] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed

- `/retro` date ranges now align to midnight instead of the current time. Running `/retro` at 9pm no longer silently drops the morning of the start date — you get full calendar days.
- `/retro` timestamps now use your local timezone instead of hardcoded Pacific time. Users outside the US-West coast get correct local hours in histograms, session detection, and streak tracking.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-03-19

### Added

- **gstack now suggests skills at natural moments.** You don't need to know slash commands — just talk about what you're doing. Brainstorming an idea? gstack suggests `/office-hours`. Something's broken? It suggests `/debug`. Ready to deploy? It suggests `/ship`. Every workflow skill now has proactive triggers that fire when the moment is right.
- **Lifecycle map.** gstack's root skill description now includes a developer workflow guide mapping 12 stages (brainstorm → plan → review → code → debug → test → ship → docs → retro) to the right skill. Claude sees this in every session.
- **Opt-out with natural language.** If proactive suggestions feel too aggressive, just say "stop suggesting things" — gstack remembers across sessions. Say "be proactive again" to re-enable.
- **11 journey-stage E2E tests.** Each test simulates a real moment in the developer lifecycle with realistic project context (plan.md, error logs, git history, code) and verifies the right skill fires from natural language alone. 11/11 pass.
- **Trigger phrase validation.** Static tests verify every workflow skill has "Use when" and "Proactively suggest" phrases — catches regressions for free.

### Fixed

- `/debug` and `/office-hours` were completely invisible to natural language — no trigger phrases at all. Now both have full reactive + proactive triggers.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-03-18 — YC Office Hours

**`/office-hours` — sit down with a YC partner before you write a line of code.**

Two modes. If you're building a startup, you get six forcing questions distilled from how YC evaluates products: demand reality, status quo, desperate specificity, narrowest wedge, observation & surprise, and future-fit. If you're hacking on a side project, learning to code, or at a hackathon, you get an enthusiastic brainstorming partner who helps you find the coolest version of your idea.

Both modes write a design doc that feeds directly into `/plan-ceo-review` and `/plan-eng-review`. After the session, the skill reflects back what it noticed about how you think — specific observations, not generic praise.

**`/debug` — find the root cause, not the symptom.**

When something is broken and you don't know why, `/debug` is your systematic debugger. It follows the Iron Law: no fixes without root cause investigation first. Traces data flow, matches against known bug patterns (race conditions, nil propagation, stale cache, config drift), and tests hypotheses one at a time. If 3 fixes fail, it stops and questions the architecture instead of thrashing.

## [0.6.4.1] - 2026-03-18

### Added

- **Skills now discoverable via natural language.** All 12 skills that were missing explicit trigger phrases now have them — say "deploy this" and Claude finds `/ship`, say "check my diff" and it finds `/review`. Following Anthropic's best practice: "the description field is not a summary — it's when to trigger."

## [0.6.4.0] - 2026-03-17

### Added

- **`/plan-design-review` is now interactive — rates 0-10, fixes the plan.** Instead of producing a report with letter grades, the designer now works like CEO and Eng review: rates each design dimension 0-10, explains what a 10 looks like, then edits the plan to get there. One AskUserQuestion per design choice. The output is a better plan, not a document about the plan.
- **CEO review now calls in the designer.** When `/plan-ceo-review` detects UI scope in a plan, it activates a Design & UX section (Section 11) covering information architecture, interaction state coverage, AI slop risk, and responsive intention. For deep design work, it recommends `/plan-design-review`.
- **14 of 15 skills now have full test coverage (E2E + LLM-judge + validation).** Added LLM-judge quality evals for 10 skills that were missing them: ship, retro, qa-only, plan-ceo-review, plan-eng-review, plan-design-review, design-review, design-consultation, document-release, gstack-upgrade. Added real E2E test for gstack-upgrade (was a `.todo`). Added design-consultation to command validation.
- **Bisect commit style.** CLAUDE.md now requires every commit to be a single logical change — renames separate from rewrites, test infrastructure separate from test implementations.

### Changed

- `/qa-design-review` renamed to `/design-review` — the "qa-" prefix was confusing now that `/plan-design-review` is plan-mode. Updated across all 22 files.

## [0.6.3.0] - 2026-03-17

### Added

- **Every PR touching frontend code now gets a design review automatically.** `/review` and `/ship` apply a 20-item design checklist against changed CSS, HTML, JSX, and view files. Catches AI slop patterns (purple gradients, 3-column icon grids, generic hero copy), typography issues (body text < 16px, blacklisted fonts), accessibility gaps (`outline: none`), and `!important` abuse. Mechanical CSS fixes are auto-applied; design judgment calls ask you first.
- **`gstack-diff-scope` categorizes what changed in your branch.** Run `source <(gstack-diff-scope main)` and get `SCOPE_FRONTEND=true/false`, `SCOPE_BACKEND`, `SCOPE_PROMPTS`, `SCOPE_TESTS`, `SCOPE_DOCS`, `SCOPE_CONFIG`. Design review uses it to skip silently on backend-only PRs. Ship pre-flight uses it to recommend design review when frontend files are touched.
- **Design review shows up in the Review Readiness Dashboard.** The dashboard now distinguishes between "LITE" (code-level, runs automatically in /review and /ship) and "FULL" (visual audit via /plan-design-review with browse binary). Both show up as Design Review entries.
- **E2E eval for design review detection.** Planted CSS/HTML fixtures with 7 known anti-patterns (Papyrus font, 14px body text, `outline: none`, `!important`, purple gradient, generic hero copy, 3-column feature grid). The eval verifies `/review` catches at least 4 of 7.

## [0.6.2.0] - 2026-03-17

### Added

- **Plan reviews now think like the best in the world.** `/plan-ceo-review` applies 14 cognitive patterns from Bezos (one-way doors, Day 1 proxy skepticism), Grove (paranoid scanning), Munger (inversion), Horowitz (wartime awareness), Chesky/Graham (founder mode), and Altman (leverage obsession). `/plan-eng-review` applies 15 patterns from Larson (team state diagnosis), McKinley (boring by default), Brooks (essential vs accidental complexity), Beck (make the change easy), Majors (own your code in production), and Google SRE (error budgets). `/plan-design-review` applies 12 patterns from Rams (subtraction default), Norman (time-horizon design), Zhuo (principled taste), Gebbia (design for trust, storyboard the journey), and Ive (care is visible).
- **Latent space activation, not checklists.** The cognitive patterns name-drop frameworks and people so the LLM draws on its deep knowledge of how they actually think. The instruction is "internalize these, don't enumerate them" — making each review a genuine perspective shift, not a longer checklist.

## [0.6.1.0] - 2026-03-17

### Added

- **E2E and LLM-judge tests now only run what you changed.** Each test declares which source files it depends on. When you run `bun run test:e2e`, it checks your diff and skips tests whose dependencies weren't touched. A branch that only changes `/retro` now runs 2 tests instead of 31. Use `bun run test:e2e:all` to force everything.
- **`bun run eval:select` previews which tests would run.** See exactly which tests your diff triggers before spending API credits. Supports `--json` for scripting and `--base <branch>` to override the base branch.
- **Completeness guardrail catches forgotten test entries.** A free unit test validates that every `testName` in the E2E and LLM-judge test files has a corresponding entry in the TOUCHFILES map. New tests without entries fail `bun test` immediately — no silent always-run degradation.

### Changed

- `test:evals` and `test:e2e` now auto-select based on diff (was: all-or-nothing)
- New `test:evals:all` and `test:e2e:all` scripts for explicit full runs

## 0.6.1 — 2026-03-17 — Boil the Lake

Every gstack skill now follows the **Completeness Principle**: always recommend the
full implementation when AI makes the marginal cost near-zero. No more "Choose B
because it's 90% of the value" when option A is 70 lines more code.

Read the philosophy: https://garryslist.org/posts/boil-the-ocean

- **Completeness scoring**: every AskUserQuestion option now shows a completeness
  score (1-10), biasing toward the complete solution
- **Dual time estimates**: effort estimates show both human-team and CC+gstack time
  (e.g., "human: ~2 weeks / CC: ~1 hour") with a task-type compression reference table
- **Anti-pattern examples**: concrete "don't do this" gallery in the preamble so the
  principle isn't abstract
- **First-time onboarding**: new users see a one-time introduction linking to the
  essay, with option to open in browser
- **Review completeness gaps**: `/review` now flags shortcut implementations where the
  complete version costs <30 min CC time
- **Lake Score**: CEO and Eng review completion summaries show how many recommendations
  chose the complete option vs shortcuts
- **CEO + Eng review dual-time**: temporal interrogation, effort estimates, and delight
  opportunities all show both human and CC time scales

## 0.6.0.1 — 2026-03-17

- **`/gstack-upgrade` now catches stale vendored copies automatically.** If your global gstack is up to date but the vendored copy in your project is behind, `/gstack-upgrade` detects the mismatch and syncs it. No more manually asking "did we vendor it?" — it just tells you and offers to update.
- **Upgrade sync is safer.** If `./setup` fails while syncing a vendored copy, gstack restores the previous version from backup instead of leaving a broken install.

### For contributors

- Standalone usage section in `gstack-upgrade/SKILL.md.tmpl` now references Steps 2 and 4.5 (DRY) instead of duplicating detection/sync bash blocks. Added one new version-comparison bash block.
- Update check fallback in standalone mode now matches the preamble pattern (global path → local path → `|| true`).

## 0.6.0 — 2026-03-17

- **100% test coverage is the key to great vibe coding.** gstack now bootstraps test frameworks from scratch when your project doesn't have one. Detects your runtime, researches the best framework, asks you to pick, installs it, writes 3-5 real tests for your actual code, sets up CI/CD (GitHub Actions), creates TESTING.md, and adds test culture instructions to CLAUDE.md. Every Claude Code session after that writes tests naturally.
- **Every bug fix now gets a regression test.** When `/qa` fixes a bug and verifies it, Phase 8e.5 automatically generates a regression test that catches the exact scenario that broke. Tests include full attribution tracing back to the QA report. Auto-incrementing filenames prevent collisions across sessions.
- **Ship with confidence — coverage audit shows what's tested and what's not.** `/ship` Step 3.4 builds a code path map from your diff, searches for corresponding tests, and produces an ASCII coverage diagram with quality stars (★★★ = edge cases + errors, ★★ = happy path, ★ = smoke test). Gaps get tests auto-generated. PR body shows "Tests: 42 → 47 (+5 new)".
- **Your retro tracks test health.** `/retro` now shows total test files, tests added this period, regression test commits, and trend deltas. If test ratio drops below 20%, it flags it as a growth area.
- **Design reviews generate regression tests too.** `/qa-design-review` Phase 8e.5 skips CSS-only fixes (those are caught by re-running the design audit) but writes tests for JavaScript behavior changes like broken dropdowns or animation failures.

### For contributors

- Added `generateTestBootstrap()` resolver to `gen-skill-docs.ts` (~155 lines). Registered as `{{TEST_BOOTSTRAP}}` in the RESOLVERS map. Inserted into qa, ship (Step 2.5), and qa-design-review templates.
- Phase 8e.5 regression test generation added to `qa/SKILL.md.tmpl` (46 lines) and CSS-aware variant to `qa-design-review/SKILL.md.tmpl` (12 lines). Rule 13 amended to allow creating new test files.
- Step 3.4 test coverage audit added to `ship/SKILL.md.tmpl` (88 lines) with quality scoring rubric and ASCII diagram format.
- Test health tracking added to `retro/SKILL.md.tmpl`: 3 new data gathering commands, metrics row, narrative section, JSON schema field.
- `qa-only/SKILL.md.tmpl` gets recommendation note when no test framework detected.
- `qa-report-template.md` gains Regression Tests section with deferred test specs.
- ARCHITECTURE.md placeholder table updated with `{{TEST_BOOTSTRAP}}` and `{{REVIEW_DASHBOARD}}`.
- WebSearch added to allowed-tools for qa, ship, qa-design-review.
- 26 new validation tests, 2 new E2E evals (bootstrap + coverage audit).
- 2 new P3 TODOs: CI/CD for non-GitHub providers, auto-upgrade weak tests.

## 0.5.4 — 2026-03-17

- **Engineering review is always the full review now.** `/plan-eng-review` no longer asks you to choose between "big change" and "small change" modes. Every plan gets the full interactive walkthrough (architecture, code quality, tests, performance). Scope reduction is only suggested when the complexity check actually triggers — not as a standing menu option.
- **Ship stops asking about reviews once you've answered.** When `/ship` asks about missing reviews and you say "ship anyway" or "not relevant," that decision is saved for the branch. No more getting re-asked every time you re-run `/ship` after a pre-landing fix.

### For contributors

- Removed SMALL_CHANGE / BIG_CHANGE / SCOPE_REDUCTION menu from `plan-eng-review/SKILL.md.tmpl`. Scope reduction is now proactive (triggered by complexity check) rather than a menu item.
- Added review gate override persistence to `ship/SKILL.md.tmpl` — writes `ship-review-override` entries to `$BRANCH-reviews.jsonl` so subsequent `/ship` runs skip the gate.
- Updated 2 E2E test prompts to match new flow.

## 0.5.3 — 2026-03-17

- **You're always in control — even when dreaming big.** `/plan-ceo-review` now presents every scope expansion as an individual decision you opt into. EXPANSION mode recommends enthusiastically, but you say yes or no to each idea. No more "the agent went wild and added 5 features I didn't ask for."
- **New mode: SELECTIVE EXPANSION.** Hold your current scope as the baseline, but see what else is possible. The agent surfaces expansion opportunities one by one with neutral recommendations — you cherry-pick the ones worth doing. Perfect for iterating on existing features where you want rigor but also want to be tempted by adjacent improvements.
- **Your CEO review visions are saved, not lost.** Expansion ideas, cherry-pick decisions, and 10x visions are now persisted to `~/.gstack/projects/{repo}/ceo-plans/` as structured design documents. Stale plans get archived automatically. If a vision is exceptional, you can promote it to `docs/designs/` in your repo for the team.

- **Smarter ship gates.** `/ship` no longer nags you about CEO and Design reviews when they're not relevant. Eng Review is the only required gate (and you can disable even that with `gstack-config set skip_eng_review true`). CEO Review is recommended for big product changes; Design Review for UI work. The dashboard still shows all three — it just won't block you for the optional ones.

### For contributors

- Added SELECTIVE EXPANSION mode to `plan-ceo-review/SKILL.md.tmpl` with cherry-pick ceremony, neutral recommendation posture, and HOLD SCOPE baseline.
- Rewrote EXPANSION mode's Step 0D to include opt-in ceremony — distill vision into discrete proposals, present each as AskUserQuestion.
- Added CEO plan persistence (0D-POST step): structured markdown with YAML frontmatter (`status: ACTIVE/ARCHIVED/PROMOTED`), scope decisions table, archival flow.
- Added `docs/designs` promotion step after Review Log.
- Mode Quick Reference table expanded to 4 columns.
- Review Readiness Dashboard: Eng Review required (overridable via `skip_eng_review` config), CEO/Design optional with agent judgment.
- New tests: CEO review mode validation (4 modes, persistence, promotion), SELECTIVE EXPANSION E2E test.

## 0.5.2 — 2026-03-17

- **Your design consultant now takes creative risks.** `/design-consultation` doesn't just propose a safe, coherent system — it explicitly breaks down SAFE CHOICES (category baseline) vs. RISKS (where your product stands out). You pick which rules to break. Every risk comes with a rationale for why it works and what it costs.
- **See the landscape before you choose.** When you opt into research, the agent browses real sites in your space with screenshots and accessibility tree analysis — not just web search results. You see what's out there before making design decisions.
- **Preview pages that look like your product.** The preview page now renders realistic product mockups — dashboards with sidebar nav and data tables, marketing pages with hero sections, settings pages with forms — not just font swatches and color palettes.

## 0.5.1 — 2026-03-17
- **Know where you stand before you ship.** Every `/plan-ceo-review`, `/plan-eng-review`, and `/plan-design-review` now logs its result to a review tracker. At the end of each review, you see a **Review Readiness Dashboard** showing which reviews are done, when they ran, and whether they're clean — with a clear CLEARED TO SHIP or NOT READY verdict.
- **`/ship` checks your reviews before creating the PR.** Pre-flight now reads the dashboard and asks if you want to continue when reviews are missing. Informational only — it won't block you, but you'll know what you skipped.
- **One less thing to copy-paste.** The SLUG computation (that opaque sed pipeline for computing `owner-repo` from git remote) is now a shared `bin/gstack-slug` helper. All 14 inline copies across templates replaced with `source <(gstack-slug)`. If the format ever changes, fix it once.
- **Screenshots are now visible during QA and browse sessions.** When gstack takes screenshots, they now show up as clickable image elements in your output — no more invisible `/tmp/browse-screenshot.png` paths you can't see. Works in `/qa`, `/qa-only`, `/plan-design-review`, `/qa-design-review`, `/browse`, and `/gstack`.

### For contributors

- Added `{{REVIEW_DASHBOARD}}` resolver to `gen-skill-docs.ts` — shared dashboard reader injected into 4 templates (3 review skills + ship).
- Added `bin/gstack-slug` helper (5-line bash) with unit tests. Outputs `SLUG=` and `BRANCH=` lines, sanitizes `/` to `-`.
- New TODOs: smart review relevance detection (P3), `/merge` skill for review-gated PR merge (P2).

## 0.5.0 — 2026-03-16

- **Your site just got a design review.** `/plan-design-review` opens your site and reviews it like a senior product designer — typography, spacing, hierarchy, color, responsive, interactions, and AI slop detection. Get letter grades (A-F) per category, a dual headline "Design Score" + "AI Slop Score", and a structured first impression that doesn't pull punches.
- **It can fix what it finds, too.** `/qa-design-review` runs the same designer's eye audit, then iteratively fixes design issues in your source code with atomic `style(design):` commits and before/after screenshots. CSS-safe by default, with a stricter self-regulation heuristic tuned for styling changes.
- **Know your actual design system.** Both skills extract your live site's fonts, colors, heading scale, and spacing patterns via JS — then offer to save the inferred system as a `DESIGN.md` baseline. Finally know how many fonts you're actually using.
- **AI Slop detection is a headline metric.** Every report opens with two scores: Design Score and AI Slop Score. The AI slop checklist catches the 10 most recognizable AI-generated patterns — the 3-column feature grid, purple gradients, decorative blobs, emoji bullets, generic hero copy.
- **Design regression tracking.** Reports write a `design-baseline.json`. Next run auto-compares: per-category grade deltas, new findings, resolved findings. Watch your design score improve over time.
- **80-item design audit checklist** across 10 categories: visual hierarchy, typography, color/contrast, spacing/layout, interaction states, responsive, motion, content/microcopy, AI slop, and performance-as-design. Distilled from Vercel's 100+ rules, Anthropic's frontend design skill, and 6 other design frameworks.

### For contributors

- Added `{{DESIGN_METHODOLOGY}}` resolver to `gen-skill-docs.ts` — shared design audit methodology injected into both `/plan-design-review` and `/qa-design-review` templates, following the `{{QA_METHODOLOGY}}` pattern.
- Added `~/.gstack-dev/plans/` as a local plans directory for long-range vision docs (not checked in). CLAUDE.md and TODOS.md updated.
- Added `/setup-design-md` to TODOS.md (P2) for interactive DESIGN.md creation from scratch.

## 0.4.5 — 2026-03-16

- **Review findings now actually get fixed, not just listed.** `/review` and `/ship` used to print informational findings (dead code, test gaps, N+1 queries) and then ignore them. Now every finding gets action: obvious mechanical fixes are applied automatically, and genuinely ambiguous issues are batched into a single question instead of 8 separate prompts. You see `[AUTO-FIXED] file:line Problem → what was done` for each auto-fix.
- **You control the line between "just fix it" and "ask me first."** Dead code, stale comments, N+1 queries get auto-fixed. Security issues, race conditions, design decisions get surfaced for your call. The classification lives in one place (`review/checklist.md`) so both `/review` and `/ship` stay in sync.

### Fixed

- **`$B js "const x = await fetch(...); return x.status"` now works.** The `js` command used to wrap everything as an expression — so `const`, semicolons, and multi-line code all broke. It now detects statements and uses a block wrapper, just like `eval` already did.
- **Clicking a dropdown option no longer hangs forever.** If an agent sees `@e3 [option] "Admin"` in a snapshot and runs `click @e3`, gstack now auto-selects that option instead of hanging on an impossible Playwright click. The right thing just happens.
- **When click is the wrong tool, gstack tells you.** Clicking an `<option>` via CSS selector used to time out with a cryptic Playwright error. Now you get: `"Use 'browse select' instead of 'click' for dropdown options."`

### For contributors

- Gate Classification → Severity Classification rename (severity determines presentation order, not whether you see a prompt).
- Fix-First Heuristic section added to `review/checklist.md` — the canonical AUTO-FIX vs ASK classification.
- New validation test: `Fix-First Heuristic exists in checklist and is referenced by review + ship`.
- Extracted `needsBlockWrapper()` and `wrapForEvaluate()` helpers in `read-commands.ts` — shared by both `js` and `eval` commands (DRY).
- Added `getRefRole()` to `BrowserManager` — exposes ARIA role for ref selectors without changing `resolveRef` return type.
- Click handler auto-routes `[role=option]` refs to `selectOption()` via parent `<select>`, with DOM `tagName` check to avoid blocking custom listbox components.
- 6 new tests: multi-line js, semicolons, statement keywords, simple expressions, option auto-routing, CSS option error guidance.

## 0.4.4 — 2026-03-16

- **New releases detected in under an hour, not half a day.** The update check cache was set to 12 hours, which meant you could be stuck on an old version all day while new releases dropped. Now "you're up to date" expires after 60 minutes, so you'll see upgrades within the hour. "Upgrade available" still nags for 12 hours (that's the point).
- **`/gstack-upgrade` always checks for real.** Running `/gstack-upgrade` directly now bypasses the cache and does a fresh check against GitHub. No more "you're already on the latest" when you're not.

### For contributors

- Split `last-update-check` cache TTL: 60 min for `UP_TO_DATE`, 720 min for `UPGRADE_AVAILABLE`.
- Added `--force` flag to `bin/gstack-update-check` (deletes cache file before checking).
- 3 new tests: `--force` busts UP_TO_DATE cache, `--force` busts UPGRADE_AVAILABLE cache, 60-min TTL boundary test with `utimesSync`.

## 0.4.3 — 2026-03-16

- **New `/document-release` skill.** Run it after `/ship` but before merging — it reads every doc file in your project, cross-references the diff, and updates README, ARCHITECTURE, CONTRIBUTING, CHANGELOG, and TODOS to match what you actually shipped. Risky changes get surfaced as questions; everything else is automatic.
- **Every question is now crystal clear, every time.** You used to need 3+ sessions running before gstack would give you full context and plain English explanations. Now every question — even in a single session — tells you the project, branch, and what's happening, explained simply enough to understand mid-context-switch. No more "sorry, explain it to me more simply."
- **Branch name is always correct.** gstack now detects your current branch at runtime instead of relying on the snapshot from when the conversation started. Switch branches mid-session? gstack keeps up.

### For contributors

- Merged ELI16 rules into base AskUserQuestion format — one format instead of two, no `_SESSIONS >= 3` conditional.
- Added `_BRANCH` detection to preamble bash block (`git branch --show-current` with fallback).
- Added regression guard tests for branch detection and simplification rules.

## 0.4.2 — 2026-03-16

- **`$B js "await fetch(...)"` now just works.** Any `await` expression in `$B js` or `$B eval` is automatically wrapped in an async context. No more `SyntaxError: await is only valid in async functions`. Single-line eval files return values directly; multi-line files use explicit `return`.
- **Contributor mode now reflects, not just reacts.** Instead of only filing reports when something breaks, contributor mode now prompts periodic reflection: "Rate your gstack experience 0-10. Not a 10? Think about why." Catches quality-of-life issues and friction that passive detection misses. Reports now include a 0-10 rating and "What would make this a 10" to focus on actionable improvements.
- **Skills now respect your branch target.** `/ship`, `/review`, `/qa`, and `/plan-ceo-review` detect which branch your PR actually targets instead of assuming `main`. Stacked branches, Conductor workspaces targeting feature branches, and repos using `master` all just work now.
- **`/retro` works on any default branch.** Repos using `master`, `develop`, or other default branch names are detected automatically — no more empty retros because the branch name was wrong.
- **New `{{BASE_BRANCH_DETECT}}` placeholder** for skill authors — drop it into any template and get 3-step branch detection (PR base → repo default → fallback) for free.
- **3 new E2E smoke tests** validate base branch detection works end-to-end across ship, review, and retro skills.

### For contributors

- Added `hasAwait()` helper with comment-stripping to avoid false positives on `// await` in eval files.
- Smart eval wrapping: single-line → expression `(...)`, multi-line → block `{...}` with explicit `return`.
- 6 new async wrapping unit tests, 40 new contributor mode preamble validation tests.
- Calibration example framed as historical ("used to fail") to avoid implying a live bug post-fix.
- Added "Writing SKILL templates" section to CLAUDE.md — rules for natural language over bash-isms, dynamic branch detection, self-contained code blocks.
- Hardcoded-main regression test scans all `.tmpl` files for git commands with hardcoded `main`.
- QA template cleaned up: removed `REPORT_DIR` shell variable, simplified port detection to prose.
- gstack-upgrade template: explicit cross-step prose for variable references between bash blocks.

## 0.4.1 — 2026-03-16

- **gstack now notices when it screws up.** Turn on contributor mode (`gstack-config set gstack_contributor true`) and gstack automatically writes up what went wrong — what you were doing, what broke, repro steps. Next time something annoys you, the bug report is already written. Fork gstack and fix it yourself.
- **Juggling multiple sessions? gstack keeps up.** When you have 3+ gstack windows open, every question now tells you which project, which branch, and what you were working on. No more staring at a question thinking "wait, which window is this?"
- **Every question now comes with a recommendation.** Instead of dumping options on you and making you think, gstack tells you what it would pick and why. Same clear format across every skill.
- **/review now catches forgotten enum handlers.** Add a new status, tier, or type constant? /review traces it through every switch statement, allowlist, and filter in your codebase — not just the files you changed. Catches the "added the value but forgot to handle it" class of bugs before they ship.

### For contributors

- Renamed `{{UPDATE_CHECK}}` to `{{PREAMBLE}}` across all 11 skill templates — one startup block now handles update check, session tracking, contributor mode, and question formatting.
- DRY'd plan-ceo-review and plan-eng-review question formatting to reference the preamble baseline instead of duplicating rules.
- Added CHANGELOG style guide and vendored symlink awareness docs to CLAUDE.md.

## 0.4.0 — 2026-03-16

### Added
- **QA-only skill** (`/qa-only`) — report-only QA mode that finds and documents bugs without making fixes. Hand off a clean bug report to your team without the agent touching your code.
- **QA fix loop** — `/qa` now runs a find-fix-verify cycle: discover bugs, fix them, commit, re-navigate to confirm the fix took. One command to go from broken to shipped.
- **Plan-to-QA artifact flow** — `/plan-eng-review` writes test-plan artifacts that `/qa` picks up automatically. Your engineering review now feeds directly into QA testing with no manual copy-paste.
- **`{{QA_METHODOLOGY}}` DRY placeholder** — shared QA methodology block injected into both `/qa` and `/qa-only` templates. Keeps both skills in sync when you update testing standards.
- **Eval efficiency metrics** — turns, duration, and cost now displayed across all eval surfaces with natural-language **Takeaway** commentary. See at a glance whether your prompt changes made the agent faster or slower.
- **`generateCommentary()` engine** — interprets comparison deltas so you don't have to: flags regressions, notes improvements, and produces an overall efficiency summary.
- **Eval list columns** — `bun run eval:list` now shows Turns and Duration per run. Spot expensive or slow runs instantly.
- **Eval summary per-test efficiency** — `bun run eval:summary` shows average turns/duration/cost per test across runs. Identify which tests are costing you the most over time.
- **`judgePassed()` unit tests** — extracted and tested the pass/fail judgment logic.
- **3 new E2E tests** — qa-only no-fix guardrail, qa fix loop with commit verification, plan-eng-review test-plan artifact.
- **Browser ref staleness detection** — `resolveRef()` now checks element count to detect stale refs after page mutations. SPA navigation no longer causes 30-second timeouts on missing elements.
- 3 new snapshot tests for ref staleness.

### Changed
- QA skill prompt restructured with explicit two-cycle workflow (find → fix → verify).
- `formatComparison()` now shows per-test turns and duration deltas alongside cost.
- `printSummary()` shows turns and duration columns.
- `eval-store.test.ts` fixed pre-existing `_partial` file assertion bug.

### Fixed
- Browser ref staleness — refs collected before page mutation (e.g. SPA navigation) are now detected and re-collected. Eliminates a class of flaky QA failures on dynamic sites.

## 0.3.9 — 2026-03-15

### Added
- **`bin/gstack-config` CLI** — simple get/set/list interface for `~/.gstack/config.yaml`. Used by update-check and upgrade skill for persistent settings (auto_upgrade, update_check).
- **Smart update check** — 12h cache TTL (was 24h), exponential snooze backoff (24h → 48h → 1 week) when user declines upgrades, `update_check: false` config option to disable checks entirely. Snooze resets when a new version is released.
- **Auto-upgrade mode** — set `auto_upgrade: true` in config or `GSTACK_AUTO_UPGRADE=1` env var to skip the upgrade prompt and update automatically.
- **4-option upgrade prompt** — "Yes, upgrade now", "Always keep me up to date", "Not now" (snooze), "Never ask again" (disable).
- **Vendored copy sync** — `/gstack-upgrade` now detects and updates local vendored copies in the current project after upgrading the primary install.
- 25 new tests: 11 for gstack-config CLI, 14 for snooze/config paths in update-check.

### Changed
- README upgrade/troubleshooting sections simplified to reference `/gstack-upgrade` instead of long paste commands.
- Upgrade skill template bumped to v1.1.0 with `Write` tool permission for config editing.
- All SKILL.md preambles updated with new upgrade flow description.

## 0.3.8 — 2026-03-14

### Added
- **TODOS.md as single source of truth** — merged `TODO.md` (roadmap) and `TODOS.md` (near-term) into one file organized by skill/component with P0-P4 priority ordering and a Completed section.
- **`/ship` Step 5.5: TODOS.md management** — auto-detects completed items from the diff, marks them done with version annotations, offers to create/reorganize TODOS.md if missing or unstructured.
- **Cross-skill TODOS awareness** — `/plan-ceo-review`, `/plan-eng-review`, `/retro`, `/review`, and `/qa` now read TODOS.md for project context. `/retro` adds Backlog Health metric (open counts, P0/P1 items, churn).
- **Shared `review/TODOS-format.md`** — canonical TODO item format referenced by `/ship` and `/plan-ceo-review` to prevent format drift (DRY).
- **Greptile 2-tier reply system** — Tier 1 (friendly, inline diff + explanation) for first responses; Tier 2 (firm, full evidence chain + re-rank request) when Greptile re-flags after a prior reply.
- **Greptile reply templates** — structured templates in `greptile-triage.md` for fixes (inline diff), already-fixed (what was done), and false positives (evidence + suggested re-rank). Replaces vague one-line replies.
- **Greptile escalation detection** — explicit algorithm to detect prior GStack replies on comment threads and auto-escalate to Tier 2.
- **Greptile severity re-ranking** — replies now include `**Suggested re-rank:**` when Greptile miscategorizes issue severity.
- Static validation tests for `TODOS-format.md` references across skills.

### Fixed
- **`.gitignore` append failures silently swallowed** — `ensureStateDir()` bare `catch {}` replaced with ENOENT-only silence; non-ENOENT errors (EACCES, ENOSPC) logged to `.gstack/browse-server.log`.

### Changed
- `TODO.md` deleted — all items merged into `TODOS.md`.
- `/ship` Step 3.75 and `/review` Step 5 now reference reply templates and escalation detection from `greptile-triage.md`.
- `/ship` Step 6 commit ordering includes TODOS.md in the final commit alongside VERSION + CHANGELOG.
- `/ship` Step 8 PR body includes TODOS section.

## 0.3.7 — 2026-03-14

### Added
- **Screenshot element/region clipping** — `screenshot` command now supports element crop via CSS selector or @ref (`screenshot "#hero" out.png`, `screenshot @e3 out.png`), region clip (`screenshot --clip x,y,w,h out.png`), and viewport-only mode (`screenshot --viewport out.png`). Uses Playwright's native `locator.screenshot()` and `page.screenshot({ clip })`. Full page remains the default.
- 10 new tests covering all screenshot modes (viewport, CSS, @ref, clip) and error paths (unknown flag, mutual exclusion, invalid coords, path validation, nonexistent selector).

## 0.3.6 — 2026-03-14

### Added
- **E2E observability** — heartbeat file (`~/.gstack-dev/e2e-live.json`), per-run log directory (`~/.gstack-dev/e2e-runs/{runId}/`), progress.log, per-test NDJSON transcripts, persistent failure transcripts. All I/O non-fatal.
- **`bun run eval:watch`** — live terminal dashboard reads heartbeat + partial eval file every 1s. Shows completed tests, current test with turn/tool info, stale detection (>10min), `--tail` for progress.log.
- **Incremental eval saves** — `savePartial()` writes `_partial-e2e.json` after each test completes. Crash-resilient: partial results survive killed runs. Never cleaned up.
- **Machine-readable diagnostics** — `exit_reason`, `timeout_at_turn`, `last_tool_call` fields in eval JSON. Enables `jq` queries for automated fix loops.
- **API connectivity pre-check** — E2E suite throws immediately on ConnectionRefused before burning test budget.
- **`is_error` detection** — `claude -p` can return `subtype: "success"` with `is_error: true` on API failures. Now correctly classified as `error_api`.
- **Stream-json NDJSON parser** — `parseNDJSON()` pure function for real-time E2E progress from `claude -p --output-format stream-json --verbose`.
- **Eval persistence** — results saved to `~/.gstack-dev/evals/` with auto-comparison against previous run.
- **Eval CLI tools** — `eval:list`, `eval:compare`, `eval:summary` for inspecting eval history.
- **All 9 skills converted to `.tmpl` templates** — plan-ceo-review, plan-eng-review, retro, review, ship now use `{{UPDATE_CHECK}}` placeholder. Single source of truth for update check preamble.
- **3-tier eval suite** — Tier 1: static validation (free), Tier 2: E2E via `claude -p` (~$3.85/run), Tier 3: LLM-as-judge (~$0.15/run). Gated by `EVALS=1`.
- **Planted-bug outcome testing** — eval fixtures with known bugs, LLM judge scores detection.
- 15 observability unit tests covering heartbeat schema, progress.log format, NDJSON naming, savePartial, finalize, watcher rendering, stale detection, non-fatal I/O.
- E2E tests for plan-ceo-review, plan-eng-review, retro skills.
- Update-check exit code regression tests.
- `test/helpers/skill-parser.ts` — `getRemoteSlug()` for git remote detection.

### Fixed
- **Browse binary discovery broken for agents** — replaced `find-browse` indirection with explicit `browse/dist/browse` path in SKILL.md setup blocks.
- **Update check exit code 1 misleading agents** — added `|| true` to prevent non-zero exit when no update available.
- **browse/SKILL.md missing setup block** — added `{{BROWSE_SETUP}}` placeholder.
- **plan-ceo-review timeout** — init git repo in test dir, skip codebase exploration, bump timeout to 420s.
- Planted-bug eval reliability — simplified prompts, lowered detection baselines, resilient to max_turns flakes.

### Changed
- **Template system expanded** — `{{UPDATE_CHECK}}` and `{{BROWSE_SETUP}}` placeholders in `gen-skill-docs.ts`. All browse-using skills generate from single source of truth.
- Enriched 14 command descriptions with specific arg formats, valid values, error behavior, and return types.
- Setup block checks workspace-local path first (for development), falls back to global install.
- LLM eval judge upgraded from Haiku to Sonnet 4.6.
- `generateHelpText()` auto-generated from COMMAND_DESCRIPTIONS (replaces hand-maintained help text).

## 0.3.3 — 2026-03-13

### Added
- **SKILL.md template system** — `.tmpl` files with `{{COMMAND_REFERENCE}}` and `{{SNAPSHOT_FLAGS}}` placeholders, auto-generated from source code at build time. Structurally prevents command drift between docs and code.
- **Command registry** (`browse/src/commands.ts`) — single source of truth for all browse commands with categories and enriched descriptions. Zero side effects, safe to import from build scripts and tests.
- **Snapshot flags metadata** (`SNAPSHOT_FLAGS` array in `browse/src/snapshot.ts`) — metadata-driven parser replaces hand-coded switch/case. Adding a flag in one place updates the parser, docs, and tests.
- **Tier 1 static validation** — 43 tests: parses `$B` commands from SKILL.md code blocks, validates against command registry and snapshot flag metadata
- **Tier 2 E2E tests** via Agent SDK — spawns real Claude sessions, runs skills, scans for browse errors. Gated by `SKILL_E2E=1` env var (~$0.50/run)
- **Tier 3 LLM-as-judge evals** — Haiku scores generated docs on clarity/completeness/actionability (threshold ≥4/5), plus regression test vs hand-maintained baseline. Gated by `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- **`bun run skill:check`** — health dashboard showing all skills, command counts, validation status, template freshness
- **`bun run dev:skill`** — watch mode that regenerates and validates SKILL.md on every template or source file change
- **CI workflow** (`.github/workflows/skill-docs.yml`) — runs `gen:skill-docs` on push/PR, fails if generated output differs from committed files
- `bun run gen:skill-docs` script for manual regeneration
- `bun run test:eval` for LLM-as-judge evals
- `test/helpers/skill-parser.ts` — extracts and validates `$B` commands from Markdown
- `test/helpers/session-runner.ts` — Agent SDK wrapper with error pattern scanning and transcript saving
- **ARCHITECTURE.md** — design decisions document covering daemon model, security, ref system, logging, crash recovery
- **Conductor integration** (`conductor.json`) — lifecycle hooks for workspace setup/teardown
- **`.env` propagation** — `bin/dev-setup` copies `.env` from main worktree into Conductor workspaces automatically
- `.env.example` template for API key configuration

### Changed
- Build now runs `gen:skill-docs` before compiling binaries
- `parseSnapshotArgs` is metadata-driven (iterates `SNAPSHOT_FLAGS` instead of switch/case)
- `server.ts` imports command sets from `commands.ts` instead of declaring inline
- SKILL.md and browse/SKILL.md are now generated files (edit the `.tmpl` instead)

## 0.3.2 — 2026-03-13

### Fixed
- Cookie import picker now returns JSON instead of HTML — `jsonResponse()` referenced `url` out of scope, crashing every API call
- `help` command routed correctly (was unreachable due to META_COMMANDS dispatch ordering)
- Stale servers from global install no longer shadow local changes — removed legacy `~/.claude/skills/gstack` fallback from `resolveServerScript()`
- Crash log path references updated from `/tmp/` to `.gstack/`

### Added
- **Diff-aware QA mode** — `/qa` on a feature branch auto-analyzes `git diff`, identifies affected pages/routes, detects the running app on localhost, and tests only what changed. No URL needed.
- **Project-local browse state** — state file, logs, and all server state now live in `.gstack/` inside the project root (detected via `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`). No more `/tmp` state files.
- **Shared config module** (`browse/src/config.ts`) — centralizes path resolution for CLI and server, eliminates duplicated port/state logic
- **Random port selection** — server picks a random port 10000-60000 instead of scanning 9400-9409. No more CONDUCTOR_PORT magic offset. No more port collisions across workspaces.
- **Binary version tracking** — state file includes `binaryVersion` SHA; CLI auto-restarts the server when the binary is rebuilt
- **Legacy /tmp cleanup** — CLI scans for and removes old `/tmp/browse-server*.json` files, verifying PID ownership before sending signals
- **Greptile integration** — `/review` and `/ship` fetch and triage Greptile bot comments; `/retro` tracks Greptile batting average across weeks
- **Local dev mode** — `bin/dev-setup` symlinks skills from the repo for in-place development; `bin/dev-teardown` restores global install
- `help` command — agents can self-discover all commands and snapshot flags
- Version-aware `find-browse` with META signal protocol — detects stale binaries and prompts agents to update
- `browse/dist/find-browse` compiled binary with git SHA comparison against origin/main (4hr cached)
- `.version` file written at build time for binary version tracking
- Route-level tests for cookie picker (13 tests) and find-browse version check (10 tests)
- Config resolution tests (14 tests) covering git root detection, BROWSE_STATE_FILE override, ensureStateDir, readVersionHash, resolveServerScript, and version mismatch detection
- Browser interaction guidance in CLAUDE.md — prevents Claude from using mcp\_\_claude-in-chrome\_\_\* tools
- CONTRIBUTING.md with quick start, dev mode explanation, and instructions for testing branches in other repos

### Changed
- State file location: `.gstack/browse.json` (was `/tmp/browse-server.json`)
- Log files location: `.gstack/browse-{console,network,dialog}.log` (was `/tmp/browse-*.log`)
- Atomic state file writes: `.json.tmp` → rename (prevents partial reads)
- CLI passes `BROWSE_STATE_FILE` to spawned server (server derives all paths from it)
- SKILL.md setup checks parse META signals and handle `META:UPDATE_AVAILABLE`
- `/qa` SKILL.md now describes four modes (diff-aware, full, quick, regression) with diff-aware as the default on feature branches
- `jsonResponse`/`errorResponse` use options objects to prevent positional parameter confusion
- Build script compiles both `browse` and `find-browse` binaries, cleans up `.bun-build` temp files
- README updated with Greptile setup instructions, diff-aware QA examples, and revised demo transcript

### Removed
- `CONDUCTOR_PORT` magic offset (`browse_port = CONDUCTOR_PORT - 45600`)
- Port scan range 9400-9409
- Legacy fallback to `~/.claude/skills/gstack/browse/src/server.ts`
- `DEVELOPING_GSTACK.md` (renamed to CONTRIBUTING.md)

## 0.3.1 — 2026-03-12

### Phase 3.5: Browser cookie import

- `cookie-import-browser` command — decrypt and import cookies from real Chromium browsers (Comet, Chrome, Arc, Brave, Edge)
- Interactive cookie picker web UI served from the browse server (dark theme, two-panel layout, domain search, import/remove)
- Direct CLI import with `--domain` flag for non-interactive use
- `/setup-browser-cookies` skill for Claude Code integration
- macOS Keychain access with async 10s timeout (no event loop blocking)
- Per-browser AES key caching (one Keychain prompt per browser per session)
- DB lock fallback: copies locked cookie DB to /tmp for safe reads
- 18 unit tests with encrypted cookie fixtures

## 0.3.0 — 2026-03-12

### Phase 3: /qa skill — systematic QA testing

- New `/qa` skill with 6-phase workflow (Initialize, Authenticate, Orient, Explore, Document, Wrap up)
- Three modes: full (systematic, 5-10 issues), quick (30-second smoke test), regression (compare against baseline)
- Issue taxonomy: 7 categories, 4 severity levels, per-page exploration checklist
- Structured report template with health score (0-100, weighted across 7 categories)
- Framework detection guidance for Next.js, Rails, WordPress, and SPAs
- `browse/bin/find-browse` — DRY binary discovery using `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`

### Phase 2: Enhanced browser

- Dialog handling: auto-accept/dismiss, dialog buffer, prompt text support
- File upload: `upload <sel> <file1> [file2...]`
- Element state checks: `is visible|hidden|enabled|disabled|checked|editable|focused <sel>`
- Annotated screenshots with ref labels overlaid (`snapshot -a`)
- Snapshot diffing against previous snapshot (`snapshot -D`)
- Cursor-interactive element scan for non-ARIA clickables (`snapshot -C`)
- `wait --networkidle` / `--load` / `--domcontentloaded` flags
- `console --errors` filter (error + warning only)
- `cookie-import <json-file>` with auto-fill domain from page URL
- CircularBuffer O(1) ring buffer for console/network/dialog buffers
- Async buffer flush with Bun.write()
- Health check with page.evaluate + 2s timeout
- Playwright error wrapping — actionable messages for AI agents
- Context recreation preserves cookies/storage/URLs (useragent fix)
- SKILL.md rewritten as QA-oriented playbook with 10 workflow patterns
- 166 integration tests (was ~63)

## 0.0.2 — 2026-03-12

- Fix project-local `/browse` installs — compiled binary now resolves `server.ts` from its own directory instead of assuming a global install exists
- `setup` rebuilds stale binaries (not just missing ones) and exits non-zero if the build fails
- Fix `chain` command swallowing real errors from write commands (e.g. navigation timeout reported as "Unknown meta command")
- Fix unbounded restart loop in CLI when server crashes repeatedly on the same command
- Cap console/network buffers at 50k entries (ring buffer) instead of growing without bound
- Fix disk flush stopping silently after buffer hits the 50k cap
- Fix `ln -snf` in setup to avoid creating nested symlinks on upgrade
- Use `git fetch && git reset --hard` instead of `git pull` for upgrades (handles force-pushes)
- Simplify install: global-first with optional project copy (replaces submodule approach)
- Restructured README: hero, before/after, demo transcript, troubleshooting section
- Six skills (added `/retro`)

## 0.0.1 — 2026-03-11

Initial release.

- Five skills: `/plan-ceo-review`, `/plan-eng-review`, `/review`, `/ship`, `/browse`
- Headless browser CLI with 40+ commands, ref-based interaction, persistent Chromium daemon
- One-command install as Claude Code skills (submodule or global clone)
- `setup` script for binary compilation and skill symlinking
